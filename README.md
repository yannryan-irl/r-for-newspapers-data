# r-for-newspapers-data
The repository for the in-progress open book, 'R for Newspaper Data'

You can build a copy of this book by cloning this github repository and opening the project in R-Studio. You'll need to put a couple of datasets back into the appropriate folder:

The boundary files for:
'Counties of England and Wales 1891' and 'Counties of Scotland Pre 1890' from https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data/ in to the data/ folder.

The title list of British and Irish newspapers, from the British Library's research repository: https://doi.org/10.23636/1136. You'll need the BritishAndIrishNewspapersTitleList_20191118.zip, unzipped to the data/ folder.

The METS/ALTO files for the Northern Daily Times (and linked titles) available on the British Library's research repository: https://doi.org/10.23636/1163. These need to be unzipped into the newspapers/ folder - Mac OS doesn't merge them, so you'll need to move the additional years into a single NLP folder - there are more details in chapter six.
