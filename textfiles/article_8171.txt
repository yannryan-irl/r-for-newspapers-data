Early  last  spring  it  was  stated,  and  on  what  must  be  conceded  as  the  very  best  authority,  that  a  large  portion  of  the  ratoons  had  perished,  owing  to  the  extraordinary  and  protracted  drought  of  the  fall  and  winter  of  1851  5  ;  and  that,  for  the  same  reason,  the  planted  cane  did  not  grow  well.  It  was  then  confidently  asserted  that  the  crop,  this  year,  under  no  circumstances,  could  be  equal  to  that  of  last.  As  the  season  progressed,  the  weather  became  very  favourable,  and  the  cane  which  sur survived  vived survived  the  drought,  grew  very  luxuriantly;  and  during  the  months  of  June  and  July,  the  general  impression  prevailed  that  the  crop  would  be  better  than  was  anticipated,  should  this  Fall  be  favourable  and  late.  During  the  last  - STYLE=superscript  week  or  two,  the  advices  have  been  unfavourable;  planters  commenced  grinding  or  rolling  the  cane  about  the  middle  of  October,  but  discovered  that  it  did  not  yield  over  one-third  or  one.half  the  usual  quantity  of  juice,  in  conse consequence  quence consequence  of  the  fact  that  it  had  not  matured,  and  then  it  became  quite  evident  that  the  maturing  was  three  weeks  to  a  month  later  than  usual.  This  has  placed  the  entire  crop  in  a  most  hazardous  position  ;  because  in  case  a  frost  should  have  come  before  the  10th  of  December,  and  which  generally  does,  then  the  growth  would  be  stopped  effectually,  or,  in  other  words,  the  cane  would  be  killed,  ren•  dering  the  yield  of  sugar  not  only  small  but  very  inferior.  Letters  have  been  received  stating  that  a  killing  frost  visited  the  sugar  plantations  on  the  night  of  the  26th  of  November.  We  have  seen  a  large  number  of  letters  from  well  informed  parties  in  New  Orleans,  and  they  all  agree  that  the  crop  will  be  materially  less  than  that  of  last  year;  some  put  down  the  deficiency  at  90,000  hhds.  ;  others  at  60,000  and  65,000  ;  but,  by  comparing  both  of  them,  the  obvious  conclusion  to  be  deduced  from  them  is,  that  the  crop  of  sugar  in  Louisiana,  the  present  year,  will  be  about  280,000  hhds.  This  would  be  considerably  less  than  the  crop  has  been  since  1851.  Below,  we  give  the  crop  for  a  series  of  years,  so  that  our  readers  may  be  enabled  to  make  the  comparison  :  Crop  /ma  Crop  Hhds.  of  '  of  of  of  'Crop  I  Hug.

The  President's  Message  to  Congress  had  not  been  delivered  in  consequence  of  ,the  House  of  Representatives  not  having  elected  a  speaker.  As  to  when  the  public  would  be  in  the  possession  of  the  document  vas-  very  uncertain,  but  it  was  most  anxiously  looked  for.  The  Message  is  under understood  stood understood  to  have  been  in  type  for  some  time,  and  it  is  said  that  very  grave  exception  is  taken  to  the  course  of  the  British  Minister,  Mr.  Crampton,  in  attempting  to  recruit  the  armies  of  his  Govern-  went  in  the  United  States  and  the  tardiness  of  the  Cabinet  of  London  to  disavow  or  apologize  for  this  conduct,  which  is  treated  by  the  Executive  as  an  unjustifiable  abuse  of  American  neutrality  laws.  Beyond  this  point  there  is  nothing  likely  to  appear  in  the  Message  which,  by  possibility,  can  be  construed  into  an  unfriendly  attitude.  By  telegraph  from  Berlin,  it  is  announced  that  at  a  meeting  of  the  committee  of  the  Bank  of  Prussia,  held  yesterday,  they  have  resolved  to  raise  the  rate  of  interest  from  4  to  5  per  cent  on  commer commercial  cial commercial  account  balances,  and  from  51  to  6  per  cent  on  deposits  of  shares  and  other  public  securities.  According  to  the  returns  of  the  National  Bank  of  Belgium  for  the  year  ending  the  31st  of  Dec.,  1855,  it  appears  that  the  amount  of  bullion  in  their  coffers  has  increased  three  millions  of  franks  during  the  month  of  December,  and  four  and  a-half  millions  compared  with  the  previous  year.  In  other  respects,  the  situation  of  the  bank  is  most  satisfactory,  and  the  chief  director  congratulates  his  coadjutors  on  having  so  successfully  overcome  the  financial  difficulties  of  the  year.  Accounts  from  Madrid  mention  that  the  protest  of  the  Catalonian  deputies  against  the  re-establish re-establishment  ment re-establishment  of  the  tariffs,  was  presented  to  the  Cortes  on  the  4th  iust.,  and  a  stormy  debate  was  expected  to  be  raised  by  the  Democrats  on  this  important  question.  .  _  -  From  Rome  accounts  state  that  the  pontifical  Minister  of  Finance  will  have  some  difficulty  in  making  up  the  deficit  of  888,826  scudi,which  occurs  in  the  estimated  expenditure  for  1856.  The  total  for  the  year  is  put  down  at  2,275,598  scudi.  It  appears,  from  the  recent  meeting  of  the  Ecuador  Bondholders,  that  the  last  dividend,  due  in  January,  is  not  to  be  paid  until  next  May,  in  consequence  of  the  delay  which  must  take  place  in  the  transmission  of  the  money.  The  government  of  Ecuador  seem  desirous  of  carrying  out  their  agreement  with  the  bondholders,  and  the  latter  consider  that,  under  the  circumstances,  it  would  be  advisable  to  procure  the  quotation  of  the  Bonds  in  the  official  list  of  the  Stock  Exchange,  and  also  that  Mr.  Mocato's  terms  relative  to  the  Consoli Consolidated  dated Consolidated  Bonds,  should  be  agreed  to.  The  resolutions  adopted  embodied  these  two  suggestions.  The  English  Funds  experienced  a  rally  of  =Z =Zper  per =Zper  cent.  at  the  opening  this  morning.  At  a  later  hour,  however,  sales  of  stock  on  government  account,  being  understood  to  continue,  a  relapse  took  place,  and  prices  finally  closed  at  861  86k.  Money,  to-day,  was  in  good  demand,  but  without  pressure-  In  .the  Stock  Exchange,  the  current  rate  was  five  per  cent.  on  Government  Securities.  At  Paris,  to-day,  the  Three-per-Cents  closed  4  to  per  cent  lower  than  yesterday.  The  amount  of  specie  brought  in  by  the  Baltic,  from  New  York,  is  stated  at  60,0001.  This  supply  is  not  expected  to  remain  here.  The  Tagus  has  taken  60,4461.  in  specie,  for  Lisbon  and  Cadiz.

YOUNG  MEN'S  CHRISTIAN  ASSOCIATION.—Rm  v.  MR.  OWEN'S  LECTURE.  —T  he  fifth  of  the  series  of  lectures  in  connection  with  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association  was  delivered  in  the  Hope-hall,  Hope-strew,  last  night,  by  the  Rev.  J.  B.  Owen,  M.A.,  of  London.  The  subject  was,  The  Talkers  of  The  chair  was  taken  by  John  Cropper,  Esq,  There  was  a  very  full  au  litory.  Shortly  before  eight  o'clock  the  proceedings  commenced,  when  the  chairman,  in  a  few  words,  introduced  the  lecturer  and  the  subject  of  his  discourse.  The  lecturer  then  proceeded  with  his  subject,  which  he  treated  in  a  highly  interesting  and  effective  manner,  confining  himself  simply  to  an  illustration  by  a  series  of  well  drawn  character-sketches  of  the  different  frivolous,  worthless,  or  objectionable  forms  in  which  the  too-voluble  talkers  of  indulge.  Among  the  principal  characters,  the  lecturer,  humorously  as  well  as  forcibly  illustrated,  were  the  hyperbolist,  the  egotist,  the  monopolist,  the  stock-phraser,  the  pot-valiant,  and  many  others.  The  audience  were  interested,  as  well  as  instructed,  and  testified  their  approval  by  frequent  applause.  GARSTON  BOARD  OP  HEALTIi.—The  monthly  meeting  of  this  board  was  held  yesterday  evening  at  Garston,  J.  A.  Tinne,  Esq.,  in  the  chair.  The  following  members  were  present,  Messrs.  John  Bevan,  Charles  Chaloner,  William  Pritt,  John  F.  Goodman,  and  John  G.  Morris.  The  minutes  of  the  last  meeting  having  been  read  and  con confirmed,  firmed, confirmed,  a  question  arose  in  reference  to  a  contemplated  railway  from  Garston  to  Liverpool,  which,  it  was  stated,  would  interfere  with  Bailey's  Lane  in  this  way—the  lane  would  be  sunk  at  one  place  seven  feet  six  inches,  and  raised  in  another  to  eight  feet.  The  question  was  referred  to  the  works'  committee.  It  was  announced  that  the  intended  amalgamation  act  had  been  lodged,  but  had  been  again  withdrawn  by  the  promoters.  The  surveyor  was  called  on  to  report  on  the  state  of  certain  streets  in  the  district,  which  were  stated  to  be  in  a  bad  state.  The  proceedings  of  the  finance  committee  were  then  confirmed  ;  and  after  the  transaction  of  the  u,ual  routine  business,  the  meeting  separated.  _  _  _  CORONER'S  INQUESTS.—Yesterday  the  deputy-coroner,  Mr.  Statham,  held  the  following  inquests  :—On  the  body  of  Ellen  M'Laughlin,  aged  seven  years,  the  daughter  of  a  labourer  res'ding  in  St.  Martin's  street.  The  child  died  suddenly  from  convulsions,  which  arose  from  natural  causes.  Verdict  accordingly.—On  the  body  of  a  woman  named  Margaret  Evans,  aged  41,  who  resided  in  a  court  off  Hornby-street,  who  died  suddenly  of  natural  causes.  Verdict  accordingly.—On  the  body  of  :John  Nelson,  aged  33,  a  sailor,  who  boarded  at  No.  72,  Park-lane.  He  died  from  disease  of  the  lungs,  from  natural  causes.  Verdict  accordingly.—On4he  body  of  Owen  Donley,  aged  55,  who  resided  in  a  court  off  Chisenhale-street.  The  deceased  was  a  printer.  He  was  crossing  one  of  the  docks,  when  his  foot  slipped  on  the  rails,  and  some  waggons  coming  up,  passed  over  his  limbs,  and  produced  injuries  of  which  he  died.  There  was  no  blame  attached  to  any  one.  Verdict  —Accidental  death.  THE  BARQUE  CHEROKEE.—The  following  appears  in  a  Waterford  paper  :—A  barque  named  the  Cherokee,  of  265  tons,  of  and  for  Liverpool,  from  Benin,  Africa,  with  palm  oil,  ran  into  this  harbour,  during  a  heavy  S.E.  gale  on  Monday  night,  and  dr  Ipped  anchor  between  Dunmore  and  Creden-head,  where  she  continued  to  ride  for  some  time  with  a  heavy  sea  running,  and  wind  and  tide  up.  The  strain  eventually  proved  too  much,  an  d  she  burst  her  anchor  chain,  drifted  above  Creden-h  e  ad,  let  go  her  second  anchor,  and  after  a  short  time  s  napped  her  second  chain.  The  Pilot  cutter  Seagull  put  three  additional  pilots  on  board  the  barque  who  bro  u  ght  her  to  Ballyhack,  and  ran  her  without  damage  into  the  mud,  where  sh  e STYLE=superscript  now STYLE=superscript  lies. STYLE=superscript  It STYLE=superscript  appears  the  Cherokee  last  week  put  into  Bantry-bay,  tin.  navigable,  in  consequence  of  great  mortality  amongst  the  crew,  nine  of  them  having  died  seven  lying  sick  in  their  berths,  and  only  the  master,  one  man,  and  a  boy  remaining  fit  for  duty.  Some  men  were  shipped,  and  the  steam  tug  Rattler,  184  _oils,  Barnes,  having  proceeded  from  Liver Liverpool  pool Liverpool  for  the  purpose,  took  her  in  tow  for  her  destination,  but  when  off  this  harbour,  the  wind  and  sea  being  very  violent,  they  were  forced  to  part  company,  and  both  ran  for  Waterford,  the  steamer  arriving  about  two  hours  before  the  vessel.  The  Rattler  came  up  to  this  city,  and  having  coaled,  proceeded  to  Passage.  The  estimated  value  of  the  cargo  of  the  Cherokee  is  £15,000.  A  claim  of  £lOOO  has  been  made  by  the  Harbour  Commissioners  for  the  services  rendered  by  the  pilots,  who  will,  of  course,  be  deservingly  rewarded  by  the  board.  The  Cherokee  is  now  in  the  possession  of  James  Delahunty,  Esq.,  the  Receiver  of  Droits  of  Admiralty.  mmst..Mt  LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.  SECOND  EDITION.  THE  CRIMEA.  DESPATCH  FROM  GENERAL  CODIIINGTON  The  Gazette  of  last  night  contains  a  despatch  received  by  Lord  Panmure,  from  Genera  1  Cod Codrington,  rington, Codrington,  Commander-in-Chief  of  Her  Maiesty's  forces  serving  in  the  Crimea.  The  following'  are  extracts  :  SEBASTO  POL,  DEC.  25nr.  My  Lord,—Notwithstanding  the  recent  severe  weather  (the  thermometer,  a  few  nights  ago,  having  fallen  nearly  to  zero),  the  general  state  of  the  health  of  the  army  has  continued  good.  The  roads  are  in  fair  working  order,  and,  though  the  efficiency  of  the  locomotive  engines  was  impared  by  the  frost,  the  damage  has  been  made  good.  The  final  operations  on  the  docks  have  been  somewhat  delayed  on  one  side,  by  the  influx  of  water,  and  by  the  freezing  of  pumps.  The  fire  from  the  ports  on  the  northern  side  of  the  harijour  continues,  and  it  is,  at  times,  bevy,  but  the  casualties,  I  am  happy  to  say,  are  few.  There  has  been  no  movement  of  importance  orr  the  part  of  the  enemy  in  our  neighbourhood  of  late.  A  detachment  of  French  troops  surprised  , STYLE=superscript  a  Cossack  post,  near  Teilion,  a  few  days  ago,  killing  several  men,  and  taking  the  rest  prisoners.  The  general  drill  of  the  army  makes  goodi.  progress."
