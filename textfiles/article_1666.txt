"CUBA  We  have  advice  - STYLE=superscript  s  from  Havana  to  the  26th  Sept.  They  inform  us  of  the  arrival  of  600  additional  African  slaves,  the  landing  of  whom  had  been  safely  effected  at  or  near  Trinidad  de  Cuba,  and  the  property  disposed  of  with  the  assent  of  the  local  authorities  ;  and  the  facts  have  been  brought  to  the  attention  of  General  Canedo,  by  the  British  Consul-General  at  the  Havana.  A  correspondent  says  This  makes  one  thousand  ne negroes,  groes, negroes,  within  this  month,  on  the  south  side.  The  last  vessel  —the  name  not  ascertained—is  being  hurriedly  fitted  and  furnished  for  another  voyage,  and  will  probably  be  at  sea  before  a  commission  can  reach  Trinidad  for  her  seizure.  These  landings  are  made  at  the  time  we  are  having  prepared  in  the  Palace,  the  strongest  argument  yet  sent  forward,  to  convict  the  British  Government  of  gross  injustice,  in  charg charging  ing charging  the  Spanish  Government  with  want  of  good  faith  in  observance  of  the  treaty,  and  the  colonial  authorities  with  corrupt  connivance  in  the  iniquitous  traffic.  COMMERCIAL  INTELLIGENCE  NEW  YORK  MARKETS,  OCT.  4.  STOCKS  AND  MONEY.—The  Stock  Exchange  opened  with  a  fair  degree  of  firmness  this  morning,  but  on  the  second  call  of  the  list,  at  the  early  board,  prices  fell  off,  and  a  feel feeling  ing feeling  of  depression  was  observable  through  the  remainder  of  the  day.  The  fall  in  Erie  stock  from  the  top  rate  of  the  forenoon  was  1  per,  cent.,  and  in  Cumberland  coal  li  per  cent.  Other  speculations  gave  way  to  1 STYLE=superscript  4  per  cent.,  with  the  .exception  of  Hudson  River,  which  showed  steadiness  through  the  day  at  714  for  the  cash  stock,  and  721  on  time.  Among  the  higher  class  shares,  business  was  done  in  New  York  Central  at  1131;  Michigan  central  1111,  and  Michigan  southern  at  119  i.  There  was  an  active  inquiry  to-day  for  money  from  demand  borrowers,  and  the  offerings  rather  less  free.  Lenders  are  disposed  to  give  preference  to  first  class  mercantile  paper,  at  9  to  10  per  cent.,  though  this  is  not  the  case  with  the  banks,  restricted  as  they  are  to  7  per  cent.

Notwithstanding  the  unfavourabte  tenor  of  the  advices  for  Cotton,  our  market  has  been  only  slightly  depressed,  the  quantity  offering  being  small,  and  the  reports  of  injury  to  the  growing  crop  being  more  general  and  decisive  ;  grades  above  middling  are  scarce,  and  bring  full  rates,  while  the  lower  qualities  are  neglected.  The  new  crop  comes  forward  slowly,  the  receipts  to  last  dates  being  33,000  against  83,000  same  period  last  year  ;  but  the  quality  is  poor,  the  bulk  being  under  mid middling.  dling. middling.

The  transac transactions  tions transactions  have  been  very  large,  and  would  have  been  larger  but  for  the  limited  supply  here,  the  high  rates  of  freights  and  the  difficulty  in  procuring  vessels  ;  as  it  is,  a  large  por portion—more  tion—more portion—more  than  half—=of  the  sales  are  for  future  delivery.
