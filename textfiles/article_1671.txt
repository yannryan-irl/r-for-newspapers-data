"TURKEY  AND  RUSSIA  CONSTANTINOPLE,  OCT  B.  On  the  27th  Lord  Stratford  was  admitted  to  the  presence  of  the  Sultan,  from  whom  he  obtained  a  solemn  promise  that  war_  should  not  be  declared  before  the  Ist  Moharrem  (15th  of  October).  A  messenger  was  accordingly  immediately  despatched  to  Omer  Pasha,  with  positive  instructions  to  abstain  from  all  hostilities  until  that  date,  and  to  make  known  to  Prince  Gortschakoff  that  such  would  be  the  case.  .  ST.'  PETERSBURG,  OCT.  4.â€”The  news  of  the  resolve  of  France  and  England  to  send  their  fleets  to  the  Dardanelles,  and  that  four  frigates  had  already  appeared  before  Constantinople,  had  very  much  damped  the  militant  ardour  of  the  people.  The  Cronstadt  fleet  would  be  safely  blocked  in  by  the  ice,  but  alarm  was  felt  for  that  in  the  Black  Sea.  The  rep6rts  of  diplomatic  victories  gained  by  Russia  over  Persia  are  false."
