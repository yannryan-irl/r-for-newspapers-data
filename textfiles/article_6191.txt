The  Queen  and  Prince  Albert,  'it  is  at  present  ar arranged,  ranged, arranged,  will  leave  here  on  Thursday  next,  the  22nd  inst.,  for  Windsor  Castle,  there  to  pass  the  Christmas  holidays.  Her  majesty's  emigration  commissioners  have  advertised  for  two  more  ships  —one  for  Melbourne,  to  be  ready  to  receive  passengers  on  the  7th  of  February  next,  and  the  other  for  Geelong,  to  be  ready  on  the  10th  of  the  same  m  onth.

Mr.  M'Philli M'Phillimore,  more, M'Phillimore,  of  Waterloo-road,  was  most  efficient  in  his  efforts  to  x  tingnish  the  fire,"
