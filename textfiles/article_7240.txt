"PROVISION  MARKET.  The  market  for  BEEF  has  been  inactive  this  week,  but  we  look  for  a  better  demand  early  in  the  new  year,  as  the  stocks  in  the  hands  of  the  trade  are  light.  PORK,  also,  has  ruled  dull  ;  there  is,  however,  less  disposition  to  press  sales  than  in  the  beginning  of  the  month.  Some  small  parcels  of  new  BACON  have  been  taken  at  the  quotations  ;  the  dealers  anti anticipate  cipate anticipate  lower  prices  and  buy  sparingly.  SsouLnnts  move  more  freely.  There  is  very  little  doing  in  LARD  on  the  spot;  a  sale  for  spring  delivery  at  50s  is  reported.  CHEESE,  I  where  fine,  sells  readily  ;  ordinary  sorts  are  neglected.  TALLOW  is  very  active,  at  a  farther  advance  of  is  to  2s  cwt.  LINSEED  CAKE  is  in  moderate  request.  Notwith Notwithstanding  standing Notwithstanding  the  general  disinclination  to  business  which  always  exists  at  the  close  of  the  year,  we  have  had  an  active  daily  demand  since  our  last  in  the  Corn  market  for  all  articles,  at  a  farther  advance  of  2d  to  34  d  9  701  be  on  WHEAT  3d  to  6d"
