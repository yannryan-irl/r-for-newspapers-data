On  the  14th  inst.,  at  No,  1,  Broueham-street,  T STYLE=superscript  oxteth-park,  of  enlargement  of  the  heart,  aged  20  years,  Ellen,  the  beloved  wife  of  Mr.  Janes  Jones,  Contractor,  and  only  daughter  of  Mr.  George  John  Newton,  Toxteth-park.  tar  Births,  hlarriages,  and  Deaths,  are  only  inserted  when  sent  to  our  0111  co  duly  a►tth9Xlticated.  The  cashier  of  the  Bank  of  France,  on  making  up  his  accounts  for  the  day,  on  the  30th  ult.,  missed  172  notes  of  1000  francs  each,  which  had  been  brought  to  him  in  the  course  of  the  day,  and  which,  after  counting,  he  had  placed  with  other  piles  of  notes  on  a  shelf  near  him.  Search  was  made  everywhere,  but  without  result,  and  information  was  immediately  given  to  the  police.  From  the  inquiries  which  they  made,  their  suspicions  pointed  to  one  of  the  clerks  in  the  cashier's  office,  and  orders  were  given  that  he  should  be  strictly  watched.  New-Year's  day  being  a  holiday  at  the  Bank,  the  man  left  Paris  in  the  evening  of  the  31st  ult.  to  visit  his  friends  in  a  village  in  Picardy,  and  the  chief  of  the  service  de  surete  and  some  active  agents  followed  him  there.  Early  the  next  morning  they  learnt  that  he  had  gone  into  the  wood  on  a  pretext  of  shooting,  and  they  went  towards  the  wood.  They  did  not  hear  any  report  o  f  fire-arms,  and  after  a  while  the  man  re returned  turned returned  without  any  game.  This  naturally  increased  the  suspicions  against  him.  In  the  evening  of  the  Ist  he  came  back  to  Paris,  the  police  still  accompanying  him,  and  the  following  days  they  watched  him  so  closely  and  with  such  skill  that  they  saw  all  he  did,  and  almost  heard  all  he  said.  At  last  it  was  deemed  advisable  to  arrest  him,  but  he'energetically  denied  his  guilt,  and  on  his  lodgings  being  searched  nothing  calculated  to  incul inculpate  pate inculpate  him  could  be  discovered.  The  chef  de  surete  accordingly  determined  on  going  down  to  Picardy  to  examine  the  wood  in  which  the  man  had  been;  but,  though  he  inspected  every  tree,  he  could  find  no  marks  on  any  one,  and,  though  he  caused  the  earth  to  be  dug  up  wherever  it  appeared  to  have  been  recently  moved,  he  discovered  nothing.  The  day  before  yesterday  he  determined  to  try  the  effect  which  the  sudden  revelation  that  he  had  been  constantly  followed,  from  the  very  moment  of  discovering  the  robbery,  would  produce  on  the  man;  and  he  began  by  stating  that  on  the  31st  of  December  he  had  followed  him  to  the  wood  in  question.  The  man  started,  and  when  the  chef  de  surete  proceeded  to  - STYLE=superscript  relate  to  him  all  that  he  had  done  on  the  following  days,  hour  by  hour,  he  seemed  astounded.  At  last  he  confessed  that  he  was  the  thief,  and  he  stated  that  he  had  buried  the  notes  beneath  a  particular  tree  in  the  wood  in  question.  In  consequence  the  chef  again  visited  the  wood,  and  found  the  notes  at  the  place  mentioned.  The  clerk  is  to  be  brought  to  trial—ealignani's  .Messenger."
