"LOUIS  PHILIPPE  might  bllowin.r,  a  bold  and  comprehensive  line  of  commercial  policy;  but  his  habits  and  views  were  of  a  different  order.  He  was  great  in  political  intrigue,  and  - STYLE=superscript  to'  accom accomplish  plish accomplish  a  coup  de  main  was  his  gretitest  ambition.  His  sons  in  the  infancy  of  their  iniblic  career  as assumed  sumed assumed  the  airs  and  character  of  their  father,  and  while  one  threatened,  by  a:variety  of  inuendoes,  to  invade  England,  another  took  up  the.  character  of  a  great  military  leader,  and  embarked  in  the  cam-  paign  of  Algeria  In  each  case  ngland  was  deeply  interested  and,  consequently,  much  excitement  was  produced  in  the  public  mind,  and  no  inconsiderable  increase  in  our  military  expenditure  ensued.
