The  governor  reviews  the  affairs  of  the  Western  and  Atlantic  Railroad  at  some  length.  ,  The  $525,000  appro appropriated  priated appropriated  by  the  legislature  by  the  act  of  January  15,  1852,  would  have  been  sufficient  to  put  the  road  in  good  condition,  but  for  the  fact  that  by  much  the  larger  portion  of  it  had  to  be  applied  to  the  payment  of  debts  which  had  been  accu accumulating  mulating accumulating  from  its  first  organisation.  The  revenues  of  the  road  had  therefore  to  be  used  to  make  up  the  deficiency,  and  the  present  report  of  the  superintendent  will,  therefore,  show  no  profits  received  for  the  work,  into  the  State  Treasury.  The  governor  is  adverse  to  selling  the  road  or  any  part  of  it  to  a  private  company.  He  deems  that  the  best  method  of  conducting  its  affairs,  is  under  the  management  of  the  executive  of  the  State,  and  a  superintendent  to  be  appointed  by  him.  The  elections  in  the  state  of  Louisiana  have  gone  in  favour  of  the  administration  candidates  by  very  large  majorities.

A  dispatch  from  Natchez  states  that  the  yellow  fever  had  re-appeared  there,  and  that  a  number  had  died  of  the  disease.  The  New  York  Commercial  Advertiser  reports  that  Mr.  Crampton,  the  British  minister,  has  formally  denied  the  allegations  that  his  government  contemplated  any  such  proceedings  with  regard  to  Cuba  as  have  been  attributed  to  it.  The  steam steamship  ship steamship  Isabel  arrived  at  Charleston  with  advices  from  Havana  to  the  3th  instant,  reports  that  there  is  some  political  excitement  in  Cuba.  Several  arrests  had  been  made,  and  some  alarm  was  felt  by  the  government.  A  number  of  the  revolutionary  paper,  Vox  del  Puebla,  had  been  issued.  There  was  also  a  story  about  a  vessel  having  appeared  off  Baracoa,  at  the  east  end  of  the  island,  and  that  at  a  signal  made  by  her,  the  fort  was  attacked  by  about  seventy  men  on  horseback—a  rather  unusual  mode  of  attacking  a  fort.  The  reports  ad-  1 STYLE=superscript  that  some  of  these,  horse  marines,  shall  we  call  them,  were  made  prisoners,  and  were  already  on  their  way  to  Havana  when  the  Isabel  sailed.  The  Washington  correspondent  of  the  New  York  Evening  Post  sends  intelligence  of  considerable  interest  concerning  the  Sandwich  Islands  project  of  annexation,  and  also  concerning  Mexican  affairs.  It  seems  that  a  letter  has  been  received  from  an  army  officer  on  the  Rio  Grande,  that  two  members  -of  the  Mexican  ministry  at  the  termination  of  the  war  with  the  United  States,  who  took  an  active  part  in  promoting  the  expulsion  of  Santa  Anna„  have  been  summarily  shot  without  even  the  form  of  a  trial.  One  of  them  was  Luis  de  la  Rosa,  who  was  formerly  Mexican  minister  at  Washington.  This  intelligence  is  regarded  as  very  important,  as  indicating  the  determination  of  Santa  Anna  to  test  his  ascendancy  and  to  act  with  absolute  indepen independence  dence independence  in  his  position.  It  is  known  that  he  is  personally  disposed  to  sell  further  portions  of  terri territory  tory territory  to  the  United  States,  and  also  to  release  America  from  her  treaty  stipulations  concerning  the  Indians  of  New  Mexico,  for  a  consideration:  and  the  issue  of  this  affair  will  test  his  ability  to  carry  out  such  an  arrangement  From  the  Sand Sandwich  wich Sandwich  Islands  there  is  every  prospect  of  an  early  application  for  annexation  to  the  United  States  ;  7  ---  and  there  is  no  doubt  that  it  will  be  favourably  received  by  the  American  government.  King  Ka Kamehama  mehama Kamehama  is  said  to  be  anxious  for  its  consummation.  At  a  meeting  of  the  Hawaiian  cabinet  held  after  Dr.  Judd's  retirement,  every  member  voted  for.  it  except  Mr.  Wyllie,  minister  of  foreign  affairs,  who  is  a  Scotchman  and  warmly  opposed  to  it.  There  is  scarcely  a  doubt  entertained  in  the  island  of  the  speedy  consummation  of  the  scheme.  From  Kingston,  Canada,  we  learn  that  on  the  12th  inst.  a  fire  broke  out  on  one  of  the  steam-boat  wharves  at  the  foot  of  Store-street,  which  destroyed  the  bonded  warehouse  of  Mr.  J.

John  Hamilton,  and  the  warehouses  of  McPherson  and  Crane,  Mr.  Hendy,  and  Watts  and  Donohue.  •  The  property  destroyed  was  no  doubt  large.

Loans  on  call  are  re reported  ported reported  to  have  been  negociated  as  low  as  seven  per  per  cent.,  where  the  security  was  undeniable.  The  rates  of  discount  had  not,  however,  been  reduced.  The  advices  'carried  out  from  this  country  had  caused  a  decline  in  the  markets  for  bread  stuffs,  and  holders  appear  to  have  become  anxious  sellers.  Our  private  correspondent,  writing  on  the  16th,  says,  the  markets  for  bread  stuffs  we  have  to  notice  considerable  fluctation.  On  Saturday,  the  market  for  both  Flour  and  Wheat  opened  very  firm  with  a  good  demand  both  for  home  consumption  and  export,  but  at  the  opening  of  business  on  Monday  there  was  a  reaction,  and  the  business  done  on  that  day  was  only  limited,  with  prices  favouring  the  buyer.  The  receipt  of  the  Baltic's  advices  late  on  in  the  day  caused  a  further  decline  in  almost  all  descriptions,  but  chiefly  in  Common  State  Brands.  The  decline  is  121  cents.  per  brl.  In  Southern  Flour  there  was  a  moderate  demand,  and  prices  were  about  the  same.  Canadian  in  bond  was  in  demand  and  firm.  The  Cotton  market  continued  dull,  and  the  tran transactions  sactions transactions  limited,  although  sellers  appeared  willing  to  give  way  a  little  in  price.
