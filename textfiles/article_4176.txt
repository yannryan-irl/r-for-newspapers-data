"MONETARY  AND  COMMEROAL:  LIVERPOOL,  FRIDAY  EVENING.  By  the  screw  steamer  Glasgow  which  arrived  in  the  Clyde  this  morning,  we  have  advices  three  days  later  than  those  previously  received:  They  report  the  arrival  of  the  Africa  at  New  York  on  the  4th.  The  Cotton  Market  had  not  been  effected  by  the  Africa's  advices:  The  weather  is  again  reported  In  the.market  forßreadstuffs  the  outward  news,  howerer,  had  caused  an  advance  of.  from  181  tQ  25  c.  for  flour  ;  Southern  sour  rose  .  from  121  to  181---  e.  per  barrel.  Sales  were  made  at  737  cents  for  -  common,  to  good  brands,  Other  kinds  of  flour  and  meal  were  held  higher.  Wheat  had  alSo  'advanced.  •  Freights  remained  unaltered.

By  the  Royal  Mail  steamer  Solent,  from  the  West  Indies,  which  arrived  at  Southampton  this  after afternoon;  noon; afternoon;  we  are  in;  pessessien  Of  advices  from  Jamaica  to  the  26th  ;  Barbadoes,  27th  ;  Trinidad,  28th  ult.,  and  St.  Thomas's  to  the  Ist  November.  This  vessel  brings  the  large  sum  of  211,3061.  in  specie.  The  Commercial  intelligence  by  this  arrival  is  satisfactory.  The  produce  markets  were  quiet  and  firm  :  sugars,  cheaper  ;  coffee  was  limited  ;  and  tallow  and  corn  both  scarce  and  in  demand.  The  legislative  session  had  commenced  at  Kingston,  Jamaica.  The  yellow  fever  was  considerably  abated  in  the  other  islands,  where  heavy  rains  are  said  to  have  done  some  injury  to  the  crops.  The  islarids  generally  were  in  great  want  of  labour.  At  Jamaica,  the  exchange,  ninety  days,  was  ruled  at  1  per  cent.  premium  ;  sixty  days,  1+  per  cent.;  and  thirty  days,  2  per  cent.  premium.  In  the  London  Stock  market  there  is  evidently  a  strong  desire,  on  the  part  of  the  political  partisans  of  Russia,  to  get  up  the  prices  of  stocks,  in  order  to-magnify  the  power  and  success  of  the  Autocrat  in  the  east.  This  -is  accomplished  by  making  it  appear  that  Russia's  success  is  favorable  to  British  interests,  and  that  the  value  of  our  public  securities  is  thereby  enhanced,  while  the  victories  gained  by  the  Turks  is  used  to  lessen  the  value  of  our  stocks,  as  though  .  the  triumph  of  the  Sultan  would  be  pre  ~judicial  to  this  country.  We  have  noticed  the  working  of  this  plot  for  some  days  past,  and  to  day  the  reported  victory  of  the  Russians,  and  the  recrossing  of  the  Danube  by  the  Turks,  has  been  most  skilfully  worked  out.  The  advance  which  took  place  in  the  value  of  stocks—and  which  is  attributable  solely  to  the  rapid  accumulation  of  money  for  investment—is  made  to  appear  as  the  result  -of  a  change  in  public  opinion  in  favor  of  Russia.  On  the  announcement  of  the  arrival  of  the  large  amount  of  specie  by  the  Solent,  consols  advanced  1,  and  finally  closed  95/  to  95L  Three  and  qriarter  per  cent.,  96k  to  96?-  3  .
