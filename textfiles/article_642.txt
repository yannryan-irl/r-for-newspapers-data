"NEW  YORK  MARKETS  MONEY  MARKET,  TUESDAY,  SEPT.  20.  The  improve improvement  ment improvement  in  money  affairs  continued  to-day.  The  bank  state statement  ment statement  is  viewed  as  quite  favourable.  Call  loans  are  very  freely  supplied  at  7  per  cent.  The  banks  are  lenders  in  this  way,  preferring  it  to  time  paper.  Of  the  latter  they  make  discounts  only  to  their  most  useful  customers.  The  outside  rate  of  interest  being  so  much  higher  than  their  own,  they  do  not  feel  called  upon  to  discount  promiscuously,  as  in  easy  times.  We  find  some  evidences  of  a  let-up  in  the  press  of  paper  on  the  bill  brokers.  The  rates  are  Bto  10  per  cent.,  on  first  class,  and  10  to  12  on  other  safe  names,  but  not  generally  known  as  entitled  to  class  prime.  As  re remarked  marked remarked  a  day  or  two  since,  there  is  no  more  buying  and  selling  foreign  bills  to  raise  money.  The  regular  bankers  had  the  market  to-day  for  the  Asia  steamer,  sailing  at  noon  to-morrow.  Their  terms  are  stiffer,  say  1091  to  109  i.  Some  transient  bank  bills  were  done  in  the  forenoon,  at  109*  to  1091,  but  they  are  less  abundant.  The  supply  of  cheap  produce  Exchange,  has  fallen  off,  but  as  Flour  and  Grain,  and  the  freights  upon  these  arc  easier,  the  export  trade  promises  to  increase  in  movement.  Mercantile  and  railroad  engagements  are  being  conformed  to  the  altered  and  clear  rates  of  capital,  and  this  tends  to  relief.  The  single  apprehension  remains  of  the  resumption  of  large  ship shipments  ments shipments  of  coin,  before  the  new  cotton  crop  comes  forward.  This  would  not  be  so  important,  but  for  the  continued  accumulation  in  the  Government  coffers,  which,  from  present  signs,  will  show  full  $28,000,000  at  the  close  of  the  month,  and  no  prospect  of  disbursement.  The  Stock  market  keeps  speculative.  The  Bulls  have  the  present  control  in  several  of  the  leading  fancies.  Erie  Road  reached  85  to  85k  this  afternoon.  After  the  close.of  business  there  was  a  meeting  of  the  Directors  of  the  company  at  their  office,  foot  of  Duane-street,  and  a  dividend  of  3  p  er  cen  t.  cash,  on  Ist  October,  declared.  This  is  in  conformity  with  the  repre representations  sentations representations  of  net  earnings  added  to  the  dividend  found  since  July,  though  it  is  per  cent.  more  than  some  parties  familiar  with  the  affair  supposed  would  be  paid  out  in  cash.

THURSDAY  Among  the  semi-official  papers,  the  Pays  still  endeavours  to  attenuate  the  importance  of  the  last  intelligence  from STYLE=superscript  Constantinople--but  the  Consti  tutionel  holds  a  .different  language.  This  journal  writes  :  The  causes  of  the  new  situation  in  the  Eastern  questiOn,  are  thus  clearly  indicated.  That  situa situation  tion situation  is  not  aggravated  because  Turkey  modified  the  Vienna  note,  but  because  Russia  read  the  note  in  the  same  sense  as  that  of  Prince  Menzikoff.  If  the  chances  of  peace  have  diminished,  it  is  not  because  the  Sultan  labours  under  the  pressure  of  an  over  excited  people—it  is  because  the  Czar  puts  forth  the  same  pretentions,  and  pursues  the  same  prgjects,  .  When.  the  Sultan  appeals  to  the  protection  of  his  allies,  it  is  not  against  a  population  which  has  lately  received  him  with  every  mark  of  respect.  When  his  allies  respond  to  the  appeal,  it  is  not  to  defend  residents  whose  safety  is  not  menaced.  If  the  Sultan  - STYLE=superscript  opens  the  Dardanelles  to  English  and  French  ships  of  war,  it  is  because  he  has  thought  the  moment  arrived  to  avail  himself  of  the  right  which  the  Czar  has  given  him  by  violating  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  which  interdicted  the  passage  of  the  Pruth  to  Russian  armies  ;  and  the  'only  thought:  :that  occurs  to  us,  in  learning  that  France  and  England  have  sent  their  fleets  to  Constanti Constantinople,  nople, Constantinople,  is,  that  those  powers  have  felt  it  -be  a  point  of  honour  and  duty  to  show  by  their  acts  their  deterinination  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  Turkey,  and  equilibrium  of  The  - STYLE=superscript  llioniteur  gives  the  details  of  the  Emperor's  visit  to  J3oulogne,  with  the  usual  stereotyped  pas passage  sage passage  relativo  , STYLE=superscript  to  the  enthusiasm  of  the  population.
