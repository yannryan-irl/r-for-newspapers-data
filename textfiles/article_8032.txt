Articles  of  the  best  manufacture  have  been  marked  at  prices  so  low,  that  those  of  the  most  inferior  description  could  not  be  purchased  at  the  same  rate,  even  by  wholesale.

A  large  Stock  of  PURE  COLZL  OIL,  IMPORTED  DIRECT  FROM  THE  CONTINENT,  kept  entirely  for  the  accommodation  of  F.  L.  H.'s  Customers,  as  pure,  unadulterated  Oil  cannot  be  obtained  in  the  English  market.  The  Aureole  Lamp  having  entirely  superseded  the  Solar  Lamp  in  England,  F.  L.

H.  takes  the  opportunity  of  stating,  that  those  Persons  whr  may  hitherto  have  bean  deterred  from  'visiting  his  Establishment,  by  its  peat  extent  and  the  valuable  Collection  of  Goods,  are  not  aware  that,  by  overcoming  this  impression,  (in  reality  a  prejudice,)  the  result  would  be  most  advantageous  to  them,  as  they  would  find  that  they  can  purchase  Articles  of  a  better  quality,  and  at  Lower  Prices,  than  at  any  other  Establishment.  He  considers  it  almost  superfluous  to  add,  that,  whether  they  make  Purchases  or  other otherwise,  wise, otherwise,  they  will,  in  every  case,  be  received  with  politeness  and  atten attention.  tion. attention.
