Please  to  note  att  entively,  that  The  NORTHERN  DAILY  inserted  in  EVENTS  and  WEEKLY  T  IMES  are) STYLE=superscript  N  O  T  the  above  List.  The  above  speaks  for  itself.  The  only  reply  we  need  make  is  that  we  choose  to  conduct  our  own  business  in  our  own  way  as  we  have  done  from  the  commencement  ;  that  we  pay  higher  Wages  than  any  other  newspaper  in  Liverpool,  and  that  we  know  of  no  reason  why  we  should  study  the  whims  and  fancies  of  the  Liverpool  Tyo Tyographical  graphical Tyographical  Society??  We  wo  u  ld  remind  the  authors  of  the  document,  however,  that  they  have  rendered  themselves  amenable  to  the  law,  if  we  chose  to  act  as  vindictively  as  they  themselves  act.  We  can,  however,  afford  to  pity  and  forgive  their  malevolence,  notwithstanding,  after  three  months  hard  labour,  finding  their  circular  has  not  had  the  effect  desired,  the  authors  have,  we  have  been  given  to  understand,  made  an  appeal,  and  paid  bribes  to  certain  news  agents  not  to  exhibit  the  daily  contents  placard,  or  even  to  sell  the  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES.  We  could  scarcely  believe  the  truth  of  this,  but  we  have  recently  received  so  many  evidences  of  the  fact,  that  we  are  left  w  i  thout  any  room  to  doubt  its  correctness,  !  114 STYLE=superscript  wh STYLE=superscript  ich  will  account  for  the  complaints  we  have  tnoad  from  many  when  parties  who  have  r  e  p  resente  d  tls  that  respectable  NoßTßEutten  applying  to  purch  ase  or  su  b  scr  i  be  for  the  DAILY  TIMES,  they  have  been  strongly  pressed  to  ra  t  t  a STYLE=superscript  ke  some  other  paper  instead.  It  may,  perhaps,  be  gif  ••••  s  to  our  enemies,  to  learn  that  the  course  they  '  re STYLE=superscript  Pursui  ng  towards  us  is  producing  the  very  opposite  result  to  th  at  intended,  inasmuch  as  it  has  materially  increased  our  list  of  regular  subscribers,  which  we  are  proud  to  say  is  now  GREATER  THAN  THAT  OF  ALL  THE  OTHER  LIVERPOOL  PAPERS  PUT  TO TOGETHER.
