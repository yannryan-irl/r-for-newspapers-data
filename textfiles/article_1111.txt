"THE  SHIPWRECK  OF  THE  ANNIE  JANE JANE-THREE  -THREE JANE-THREE  HUNDRED  AND  FORTY  PAS PASSENGERS  SENGERS PASSENGERS  DROTVNED.  In  our  publication  of  Saturday,  we  announced  the  total  loss  of  the  Annie  Jane,  belonging  to  this  port,  with  between  400  and  500  souls  on  board.  The  Annie  Tane  was  a  large  vessel,  and  sailed  from  Liverpool,  for  Quebec,  and  Montreal,  on  the  9th  ult.,  with  some  450  emigrants,  most  of  them  Irish  families.  It  is  presumed  that  she  had  made  some  pro progress  gress progress  across  the  Atlantic,  when  she  encountered  the  late  fearful  south-westerly  gales,  which  disabled  her  and  rendered  her  unmanageable,  and  in  that  hopeless  condition,  she  was  driven  back  and  dashed  on  the  terrible  coast  of  Barra,  one  of  the  Hebrides.  Such  is  the  terrible  character  of  the  coast,  that  there  is  little  chance  of  a  vessel  being  rescued  when  once  it  is  entangled  among  the  reefs.  Several  of  the  survivors  contrived  to  get  a  passage  from  the  island  over  to  Torber Torbermory,  mory, Torbermory,  a  small  seaport  in  the  hie  of  Mull,  and  from  them  the  authorities  learned  that  348  passengers  were  drowned.  and  102,  with  Mr.  Bell,  the  chief  officer,  and  12  of  the  crew  saved.  A  mesage  states,  the  master,  Mr.  Mason,  was  also  preserved."
