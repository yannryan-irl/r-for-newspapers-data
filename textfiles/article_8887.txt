"urgency.  --.........-  LIABILITY  OF  INNKEEPERS—In  the  Court  of  Q  ieen's  Bench,  on  Tuesday,  Mr.  Hugh  Hill  moved  to  set  aside  the  verdict,  and  for  a  new  trial  of  the  cause  of  Cashel  v  Wright,  which  was  tried  in  the  Court  of  Record,  at  Man Manchester,  chester, Manchester,  and  in  which  a  verdict  was  found  for  the  plaintiff  for  £25.  It  was  an  action  by  a  guest  against  an  innkeeper  for  loss  of  goods  in  an  inn,  and  the  point  raised  was  whether  the  defendant  could  exonerate  himself,  by  showing  neglect  on  the  Dart  of  the  guest.  The  plaintiff  was  a  mercantile  staying  at  the  inn.  He  arrived  rather  late  in  ,ing,  and  having  gone  first  into  the  commercial  Aired  to  his  bedroom,  and  took  off  his  watch  and  and  laid  them  on  the  dressing-table,  and  on  came  o  leaving  the  door  ajar.  The  boots,  whose  duty  it  was  to  let  persons  in  during  the  night,  let  in  a  guest  at  one  o'clock,  and  another  at  three  on  the  night  in  question,  and  when  the  plaintiff  got  up  in  the  morning  he  missed  his  property.  He  made  the  fact  known  to  the  landlord,  and,  on  inquiry,  it  was  found  that  the  person  who  was  let  in  at  three  o'clock  was  not  in  his  room,  and  had  never  been  to  bed  ;  but  he  was  afterwards  taken  into  custody  and  convicted  of  the  robbery.  The  neglect  of  the  guest  was  in  not  locking  the  door,  and  leaving  it  so  far  open  that  any  one  passing  by  could  see  the  watch  and  ring  on  the  dressing-table  ;  and  as  the  neglect  conduced  to  the  loss  of  the  goods,  the  innkeeper  ought  to  be  relieved  from  all  liability.  The  defendant  contended  that  if  the  door  had  been  closed  the  loss  would  not  have  taken  place,  gentlem  Rule  gran  I  to  Show  cut"
