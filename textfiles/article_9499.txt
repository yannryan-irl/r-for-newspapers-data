"LATEST  PARTICULARS  A  rumour  prevailed  through  town  during  yesterday  even evening  ing evening  that  the  maltreated  young  man,  Mr.  Hughes,  had  died  of  the  wounds  he  had  received,  but  we  are  glad  to  state  that  the  report  proves  to  be  inaccurate.  Shortly  after  his  wounds  were  dressed  at  the  hospital,  he  requested  to  be  taken  to  his  residence  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Low-hill,  and  he  was  conveyed  there  accordingly,  and  every  attention  paid  to  him.  He  was  very  much  stunned  from  the  blows  inflicted  on  him,  and  was  considerably  exhausted STYLE=superscript  from  loss  of  blood,  and  the  terrible  struggle  in  which  he  had  been  engaged  with  the  assassins;  but,  notwithstanding,  he  was,  as  we  were  informed  last  night  at  eight  o'clock,  going  on  as  favourably  as  could  be  expected,  his  medical  attendants  being  confident  of  his  ultimate  recovery,  although  some  time  may  elapse  before  he  will  be  completely  restored  to  perfect  health  and  v  i  gour.  Much  praise  is  due  to  M  r  .  H  ughes  for  his  dete  rm  i  ned  resistance  to  the  villians  ;  f  or,  although  he  has  nearly  forfeited  his  life,  there  is  no  doubt  that  had  he  not  shown  such  determination  the  fellows  would  have  got  off  with  the  cash  box.  We  sincerely  trust  the  present  antici anticipations  pations anticipations  of  the  medical  gentlemen  will  be  speedily  realised."
