Tho  transactions  during  the  past  week  have  been  on  a  more  extended  scale,  and  without  much  change  in  prices  ;  the  market  has  assumed  a  steadier  appearance.  Holders  in  general,  are  deposed  to  sell  at  current  rates,  but  much  incon inconvenience  venience inconvenience  arises  from  the.  difficulty  of  having  samples  prepared  for  sale,  and  also  in  getting  cotton  weighed.

Unfavorable  advices,  in  the  absence  of  all  available  European  orders,  had  no  influence  upon  our  market,  the  sales  of  the  week  being  estimated  -at  1,600  bales,  taken  mostly  for  coast coastwise  wise coastwise  ports,  and  the  market  closed  very  quietly  at  quotations  herewith.
