"1717  1  6  June  1853  -15,383  3  2  Leaving  a  balance  in  favour  of  the  company  on  the  30th  June  last  of  £2616  16  10  The  receipts  from  the  sale  of  =lndic  appear  to  have  been  as  follows  :  From  the  formation  of  the  company  to  31st  December  1851  .  .  .  106  6  3  From  the  31st  December  1851  to  30th  June  1852  .  .  .  .  1421  10  1  1527  16  4  From  30th  June  1852  to  31st  De December  cember December  1852  ..  780  0  4  From  31st  December  1852  to  30th  June  1853  649  15  0  Making  the  total  receipts  to  30th  June  1853  from  the  sale  of  mundic  .  .  £2957  11  8  In  June  1852  a  dividend  of  2s  per  share  was  de declared  clared declared  upon  50,000  shares,  amounting  to  .  .  While  at  that  time  the  gross  receipts  from  the  sale  of  mundic  amounted  only  to  ..  5000  0  0  Showing  that  a  sum  of  .  .  •  .  .  .  .  was  then  declared  as  dividend  to  the  excess  of  the  amount  applicable  to  that  purpose.  The  receipts  for  mundic  in  the  year  ending  30th  June  1853  amount  to  1429  16  4  And  I  understand,  that  Mr.  A  Ben Bennett  nett Bennett  and  Mr.  Henry  Carr  re relinquish  linquish relinquish  their  dividends  to  the  extent  of  1527  16  1812  1  3  3472  3  8  3241  16  i  Leaving  a  sum  of  .  .  •..  .  •  .  .  .  .  230  7  1  still  to  be  realised  subsequent  to  the  30th  June,  1853,  to  make  up  a  dividend  declared  in  June  1852,  as  shown  in  the  accompanying  dividend  account.  reason  has  been  given  to  me  why  this  particular  sum  of  £lBl2  is.  3d.  has  thus  been  relinquished  by  Messrs.  Bennett  and  Carr;  but  you  will  no  doubt  satisfy  yourselves  whether  the  same  circumstances  which  induced  the  sacrifice  of  this  sum  should  not  require  the  relinquishment  of  a  larger  amount.  The  amount  now  dealt  with  as  the  receipts  from  mundic  is  the  gross  sum  for  which  the  mundic  sold,  the  whole  of  the  expenses,  even  down  to  the  broker's  commission,  being  charged  among  the  disbursements  in  the  cost  book.  do  not  find  that  any  stock  account  has  been  kept.  The  annexed  balance  sheet  will  show  as  much  in  detail  as  the  time  which  I  have  devoted  to  this  business  has  allowed  of  the  appropriation  of  the  funds  of  the  company,  although  I  have  asked  for  it,  I  have  been  unable  to  obtain  any  de detailed  tailed detailed  statement  of  the  preliminary  expenses,  charged  at  £220,  or  of  the  office  expenses,  postages,  stationery,  and  general  management,  charged  at  £350  per  annum.  In  the  year  1851,  there  is  a  charge  of  £l5O  made  by  Mr.  Bennett,  the  purser,  for  a  water  wheel,  which,  I  understand,  belonged  to  the  mine  at  the  time  of  the  first  constitution  of  the  company;  and  if  thii  be  so,  Ido  not  see  how  the  charge  pan  be  allowed  to  stand.  I  consider  the  disbursements,  upon  the  whole,  to  have  been  fairly  vouched,  except  as  to  the  payment  of  the  divi dividend,  dend, dividend,  the  receipts  for  which,  as  well  as  the  register  of  shares  and  transfer  book,  Mr.  Bennett,  in  the  first  instance,  refused  to  produce,.but  which  he  afterwards  (when  I  had  made  my  'arrangements  for  leaving  Wadebridge)  promised  should  be  forthcoming;  as  you  remained  at  Wadebridge  after  my  de de•parture,  •parture, de•parture,  you  would  have  the  opportunity  of  seeing  these  'documents  and  mentioning  them  in  your  report.  The  only  account  of  the  shareholders  which  I  have  seen  is  a  list  of  their  names,  addresses,  and  number  of  shares  held  by  each  entered  in  the  cost  book,  under  date  of  the  18th  August,  1853.  The  only  cash  account  said  to  be  kept  is  a  small  cash  book  containing  entries  of  the  monies  received  from  the  sale  of  mundic,  but  of  the  larger  amounts  received  for  shares  no  cash  account  whatever  has  been  produced  to  me,  nor  is  there  as  I  am  informed,  any  separate  banking  account  kept  for  the  - STYLE=superscript  company,  consequently  I  had  no  means  of  seeing  either  what  balances  were  from  time  to  time  in  hand,  or  where  the  funds  of  the  company  were  deposited.  The  monthly  payments  shown  by  the  cost  book  (of  which  the  accompanying  balance  sheet  contains  the  analysis)  are  not,  as  far  as,  dates  are  concerned,  to  be  depended  upon,  inasmuch  as  all  wages,  merchants'  bills,  &amp;c.,  for  each  month  are  charged  in  that  particular  month,  although,  with  the  exception  of  the  advances  to  the  men  and  some  other  items,  the  money  is  not  actually  .  paid  for  upwards  of  two  months  afterwards,  and  in  some  instances,  the'  payments  are  made"
