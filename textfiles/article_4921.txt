"MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL.  LIVERPOOL,  MONDAY  EVENING.  The  advices  brought  by  the  Indian  Queen  from  Melbourne  aid  to'  the  28th  of  August,  being  four  days  later  than  those  previously  received.  She  brings  38,992  ounces  of  gold.  The  accounts  brought  by  this  vessel  are  highly  encouraging,  both  for  the  colony  and  the  mother  country.  The  arrivals  of  gold  at  the  port  of  shipment  continue  on  the  usually  large  scale.  On  the  26th  August,  the  escort  from  Mclvor  and  Goulburn  brought  in  1,408  ounces,  and  on  the  same  day  the  escort  from  Castlemaine  brought  in  35,360  ounces  ;  Total,  36,768  ounces.  Value,  about  £147,072.  In  the  prices  of  all  the  trading  necessaries  of  life,  we  notice  a  change,  varying  from  5  to  20  per  cent.  in  favour  of  the  colony,  This  decline  in  the  current  quotations  leaves  a  large  profit  for  shippers.  The  number  of  hands  employed  in  the  gold  fields  shows  a  considerable  increase,  and  had  caused  a  greater  demand  for  labour  ;  we  may,.  therefore,  look  for  larger  receipts  of  gold.  The  United  States  is  beginning  to  draw  off  large  quantities  of  the  precious  metal.  The  Bavaria,  for  New  York,  had  carried  away  six  or  seven  thousand  ounces.  The  Cleopatra.  (s)  was  to  sail  for  England  on  the  first  of  September.  The  aggregate  of  shipping  arrived  at  Melbourne,  for  the  two  weeks  preceding  the  our  advices,  was  4,000  tons.  The  returns  of  the  imports  for  the  same  period  show  a  decline  in  the  arrivals  of  flour,  and  a  large  increase  in  those  of  building  materials  and  useful  implements,  from  Great  Britain,  America,  and  other  distant  ports.  These  arrivals,  together  with  the  large  amount  of  more  substantial  buildings  in  progress  in  the  city,  can.  hardly  fail  to  affect,  shortly,  the  enormous  rents  demanded  for  small  tenements,  and  promise  ultimately  to  increase  largely  the  amount  of  stor  age,  for  wholesale  and  retail  dealers.  Al Although  though Although  increased  activity  is  said  as  to  have  been  given  to  the  wholesale  trade  by  some  speculative  dealings,  nothing  had  transpired  efl'ectually  to  stop  the  downward  tendency  which  the  constant  heavy  arrivals  of  goods  occasioned.  The  flour  trade,  is,  however,  excepted  from  this  depression,  and  con continued  tinued continued  firm,  at  full  rates.  The  very  large  receipts  of  oats  keep  down  the  price  of  that  corn  ;  and  for  prime  English  .barley  lls.  was  obtained  with  diffi difficulty.  culty. difficulty.  In  the  provision  trade,  the  price  current  shows  a  further  decline  in  many  articles,  particu particularly  larly particularly  English  hams  and  bacon.  Tea,  coffee,  and  sugar  maintain  previous  rates,  except  English  loaf  sugar,  which  is  decidedly  lower.  A  decline  of  about  2d.  per  lb.  has  been  submitted  to  in  manu manufactured  factured manufactured  tobacco.  Timber  was  ten  to  twenty  per  cent.  lower,  but  the  prices  were  still  highly  favour favourable  able favourable  for  the  importers.  Exchange  on  London  for  30  days'  bills,  was  quoted  at  par,  or  one  half  per  cent.  discount  for  every  additional  thirty  days.  Freights  to  London  were  quoted  as  follows  :  Wool,  id.  to  hi.  per  lb.,  and  5  per  cent.  ;  tallow,  50s.  per  ton,  and  5  per  cent.;  gold,  41d.  per  oz.,  delivered  at  the  bullion  office.  By  the  steam  ship  Africa  we  have  advices  from  the  United  States  to  the  16th  inst.,  being  four  days  later  than  those  previously  received.  The.  Africa  brings  74  passengers,  and  500,000  dollars  on  freight.  The  crisis  in  the  Money  'market  was  not  quite  so  intense.  Among  the  bank  failures  we  notice  the  following  :  the  Oswego  Bank,  the  Bank  of  Ma  sillon,  and  the  Buffalo  Bank,  (Patchins.)  The  latter  is  one  of  the  five  remaining  chartered  banks.  The  Oswego's  notes  will  be  redeemed  in  full  by  the  New  York  Metropolitan  bank.  The  exports  of  specie  for  the  year  ending  the  11th  inst.,  was  7,761,331  dollars,  against  2,663,122  dollars  imported  within  the  same  period.  For  first-class  Paper,  the  rate  of  interest  was  12  per  cent.  Second  class,  from  15  to  18  per  cent.  Money  on  call  was  still  quoted  at  7  per  cent.
