"TUESDAY,  JANUARY  1,  1856,  MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL.  LIVERPOOL,  MONDAY  EVENING  There  has  been  no  change  of  importance  in  the  tone  of  the  Cotton  Market  to-day,  and  but  a  moderate  business  has  been  done,  at  steady  prices.  The  sales  amount  to  7000  bales,  and  include  1000  taken  for  speculation,  and  export.  The  accounts  brought  by  the  America,  advise  unusually  large  receipts  at  the  ports,  viz.,  143,000  bales  for  the  week  ending  the  19th  December,  and  considerable  exports  also  to  this  country,  viz.,  62,000  bales.  The  latest  telegraphic  advices  from  the  South  report,  however;  a  rise  in  prices  ;  middling  being  quoted  at  New  Orleans  on  the  19th,  at  9  cents,  which  with  Id  freight,  is  equal  to  58d  to  6d  per  lb.  laid  down  here.  From  the  Annual  statement  of  the  Cotton  trade  made  up  to-day,  we  leant  the  following  :  That  the  aggregate  Import  of  :the  past  year  has  been  2,278.145  Bales,  against  2,172,  730  last  year.  The  import  into  1  iverpool  has  been  2 STYLE=superscript  ,142,739  Bales,  of  which  1,608,607  have  been  American,  134,442  Brazil,  111,846  Egyptian,  279,859  Surat  and  7,985  Sundries;  against  2,065,887  bales  last  year,  1,634,200  of  which  were  American,'  107,332  Brazil,  78,942  Egyptian,  237,189  Surat,  and  8,234  sundries.  The  Exports  have  been  316,900  bales,  of  which  120,650  have  been  American,  188,600  Surat,  and  7,650  sun  d  r  i  es  ;  against  316,330  bales  last  year,  137  , STYLE=superscript  480  being  American.  168,550  Surat,  and  10,300  sundries._  The  quanta  2,101,2.  40,410  30,350  b  29.350  last  year),  1,400  Surats  (the  total  amount  being  5  360  bales  aza'nst  3,960  last  year),  and  of  560  Brazil  and  Egyptian.  The  Stocks  of  the  Kingdom  amount  to  486,470  bales  against  626,450  last  year.  Those  of  this  port,  as  determined  by  the  actual  returns  of  to-day,  are  428,810  bales,  or  34,700  bales  more  than  the  previous  weekly  estimates.  As,  however,  a  discrepancy  more  or  less  consi considerable,  derable, considerable,  and  this  in  augmentation  of  the  previous  weekly  statements,  was—because  of  the  immense  speculative  business  which  has  been  transacted—coinmonly  looked  for,  we  are  inclined  to  think  that  the  moderation  of  this  differ difference  ence difference  will  be  regarded.  with  feelings  rather  of  satisfaction  than  otherwise,  and  that  its  effects  on  the  market  will  be  unimportant.  The  Stock  comprises  231,880  bales  American,  62,900  Brazil,  48,290  Egyptian,  82,370  Surat,  and  3,370  Sundries  ;  against  551,340  bales  last  year,  of  which  295,720  were  American,  47,520  Brazil,  55,830  Egyptian,  148,750  Surat,  and  3;520  Sundries.  The  Liverpool  Share  Market  has  been  very  quiet  to-day  with  rather  a  tendency  to  giv6  way,  with  the  exception  of  Great  Western  of  Canada  Shares,  and  Dutch  Rhenish,  which  are  again  in  great  request,  particularly  the  latter  at  an  advance  of  5s  to  7s  6d  per  share  upon  Saturday's  prices;  there  are  buyers  of  the  new  Shares  at  1/  premium  upon  the  price  at  which  they  are  issued,  but  they  are  not  offered.

We  have  received  the  annual  statement  of  the  business  done  in  the  sale  of  ships  at-this  port  during  the  last  year,  made  up  by  Messrs  Curry  &amp;  Co.,'  and  also  one  published  by  Messrs.

When  the  measure  of  admitting  foreign  ships  to  British  registration  free  of  duty  was  before  the  country,  it  met  with  the  strongest  oppoqitim  from  parties  who  urged  that  we  slould  be,  inund  a  t  e  d  w  i  tti  tonnage  from  the  innumerFtble  building  stations  in  the  United  States  of  America,  from  the  Baltic,  and  elsewhere,  which  with  Rritiah  ond  ,  ,  coming'  into  comnetitic  would  Of  the  been  pia(  , STYLE=superscript  on  this  mark  of  our  plantation  ships  less  business  has  been  done.

These  facts  tell  what  the  repeal  of  the  navigation  laws  has  not  done.  We  now  desire  to  explain  to  you  what  the  new  navigation  act  has  done.  Following  the  policy  of  this  country,  the  united  kingdom  of  Sweden  and  Norway  has  removed  entirely  the  duty  upon  British  and  plantation  ships  purchased  for,  their  market,  and  the  merchants  of  these  countries  finding  they  can  pur purchase  chase purchase  cheaper  here  than  elsewhere,  have  become  our  valuable  and  respected  customers.  The  amount  of  tonnage  we  have  sold  this  year  for  Scandinavian  account  is  very  considerable,  and  nothing  can  be  more  satisfactory  than  our  transactions  in  this  new  market.  Of  the  business  done,  we  ouoto  the  following  from  Messrs.

Mr.  Thomas  Thorburn,  of  Glasgow.  has  just  issued  the  following  annual  report  of  the  Scotch  Iron  trade:—  The  year  about  to  close,  though  a  year  of  oscillations,  adds  another  mob  of  prosperity,  to  the  Iron  Trade.,  - STYLE=superscript  Under  the  agency  and  stimulus  of  war,  combined  with  the  exten extension  sion extension  of  railways,  gas,  and  water  works  abroad,  the  exports  and  home  ,consumption  of  Pig  Iron  amount  to  the  large  quantity  of  847,000  tons—exceeding  the  production  by  fully  20,000  tons—and  are  almost  equal  to  the  highest  of  any  preceding  year.  '  The  stocks'  have  consequently  undergone  a  farther  reduction,  and  are  now  only  98,000  tons  against  4.50,000  tons  three  years  ago.  Extensive  transactions  were  •made  during  the  year  in  Pig  Iron,  at  from  55s  to  82s  6d;  in  rails,  £7  10s  to  £8  15s;  in  bars.  £7  15s  to  £  9  lOs  ;  i  n  cast  iron  pipes,  £5  to  £  6  15s;  railway  chairs,  £4  15s  to  £5  stillth  e  foundries,  generaly  i  and  activem  el  e  a  a  b  n  l  d  e  well  employed.

Whilst  the  bf  neftcial  coisequences  which  must  ultimately  accrue  to  the  Iron  trade  from  the  recent  modification  of  the  French  import  duties,  and  from  the  liberal  movement  of  the  Spanish  government,  in  regard  to  the  importation  of  British  Iron  into  that  country,  have  •  not  as  yet  been  experienced.  Viewing  the  position  of  this  important  branch  of  our  local  and  national  industry  in  all  its  bearings—while  the  great  alternative  of  peace  or  war  continues  to  tremble  in  the  balance—the  prospects  of  the  ensuing  year  are  of  a  very  cheering  description.
