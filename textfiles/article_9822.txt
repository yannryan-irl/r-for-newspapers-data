"e  have  millions  of  men  at  pres  f  warfa:  in  every  imaginable  ver  and  anon,  for  aggres-  sion  and  defence,  bloodshed  must  be  their  motive,  and  other  nations  must  be  prepared  for  self-  preservation.  Our  object  in  the  present  con contest  test contest  has  been,  from  the  first,  to  secure  peace  on  a  just  and  enduring  basis.  The  Allied  Govern Governments  ments Governments  have  stated,  with  unusual  candour,  tha  t  the  war  was  not  undertaken  to  re-establish  down downtrodden  trodden downtrodden  nationalities,  or  to  extend  the  area  of  con constitutional  stitutional constitutional  freedom.  In  this  candour  the  strength  of  the  two  Cabinets  lies  for  the  moment,  and  it  is  only  Mr.  BRIGHT  and  his  followers  who  would  venture  to  say  there  has  been  any  duplicity  played  off  on  the  country  on  this  head.  With  regard  to  the  free  navigation  of  the  Danube,  Mr.  BRIGHT  was  particularly  luminous.  He  tells  us  that  the  navigation  of  that  river  is  free,  and  the  traffic  upon  it  has  increased  immensely  within  the  last  ten  years.  He  alludes  probably  to  the  enterprise  of  the  Danubian  Steam  Navigation  Company  established  ten  or  twelve  years yearsback.  back. yearsback.  He  does  not  mean  to  say  that  that  noble  stream  is  as  free  as  the  Thames,  the  Mersey,  or  the  Mississippi.  He  will  not  pretend  to  assert  that  ships  are  not  stopped  and  searched  by  Russian  on  the  Lower  Danube,  and  by  Austrian  police  on  the  frontiers  of  every  province  through  which  they  pass  from  Belgrade  to  Buda,  and  that  its  navigation  may  not  be  inter interdicted,  dicted, interdicted,  at  any  moment,  by  a  single  scratch  of  the  AIITOCRAT'S  or  FRANCIS  JOST.PH'S  pen.  We  enjoy  on  the  Danube  the  same  rights  as  pirates  do  on  the  Canton  river  in  the  absence  of  British  men-of men-ofwar.  war. men-ofwar.  We  may  trade,  if  we  can,  after  paying  Russian  exactions,  and  satisfying  Austrian  extor extortions,and  tions,and extortions,and  pocketing  in  turn  the  insulting  arrogance  of  one,  and  the  refined  tyranny  of  the  other.  Mr.  BRIGHT  has,  probably,  never  been  on  the  Danube,  and  only  speaks  from  hearsay,  and  what  he  has  gleaned  from  books  and  that  Newspaper  Press  which  he  was  pleased  to  say  could  not  writs  a  sentence  of  Manchester  men  are  apt  to  make  such  remarks,  but  they  are  the  last  in  the  world  who  ought  to  quarrel  with  those  who  make  them  intelligible  speakers,  and  something  like  rational  beings,  when  they  appear  in  t  ype,  We  can,  however,  afford  to  make  room  in  our  rubbish  bas basket  ket basket  for  Mr.  BRIGHT'S  opinion  on  this  subject,  as  well  as  a  variety  of  other  emanation  s  we  receive  from  equally  captious  reviewers.  Meanwhile,  the  Peace  Party  must  bear  in  mind  that  the  object  of  the  war  is  peace,  and  that  our  motive  in  continuing  it  embraces  all  those  disturb disturbing  ing disturbing  causes  which  must  be  removed  before  we  can  secure  the  return  of  tranquillity,  on  anything  like  an  enduring  foundation.  It  is  perfectly  childish  to  say  that  the  Four  might  have  been  obtained  from  Russia  at  the  Vienna  Conference.  It  was  because  Russia  refused  them  that  the  strug struggle  gle struggle  was  continued.  She  only  accepted  them  as  the  basis  of  negotiation,  just  as  the  Emperor  ALEXANDER  has  assented  to  the  Austrian  propositions,  to  gain  time,  or,  probably,  to  give  the  Peace  Party  of  this  country  an  opportunity  of  dividing  the  public  mind,  and  giving  a  fresh  impetus  to  that  bloodshed  which  they  are  so  anxious  to  arrest.  If  the  Peace-at-any-price  men  are  satisfied  with  the  Vienna  proposals,  it  is  not  unlikely  that  their  acceptance  by  ALEX.tNDER  will  not  only  prove  dynasty  have  thought  and  it  it  cotn-  s  not  likely  with  a  peace  by  We  small  atal:  to  his  throne,  but  will  lead  to  the  over-  ventional  necessity  ;  the  habits  of  military  life  as  throw  of  what  is  vulgarly  called  the  Romanoff  manly,  and  not  wholly  objectionable;  and,  with  The  true  Russian  and  rampant  these  glove-like  qualifications  of  what  they  con conwar  war conwar  party  are  all-powerful  at  St.  Petersburg.  sider  to  be  immutable  law,  the  world  is  deluged  The  serfs  are  ready  to  shake  off  their  with  evil-doing.  taskmasters,  and  the  Poles  only  require  The  inevitable  result  of  all  this,  however,  is  a  Russian  convulsion  to  regain  their  placed  conspicuously  before  us;  and,  since  independence.
