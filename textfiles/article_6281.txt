The  de decrease  crease decrease  in  cotton  bills  this  year,  since  Sept.  1,  as  compared  with  the  same  period  last  year,  is  equal  to  8,000,000  dollars,  while  the  increase  in  produce  bills  is  about  7,000,000  dols.  Money  is  gradually  becoming  more  abundant,  although  the  demand  was  considerable.  The  obligations  contracted  and  driven  ahead  to  carry  over  the  large.  payments,  are  now  being  met,  and  the  banks  show  more  disposi  tion  to  'meet  the  demand.  The  arrival  of  the  California  drafts,  against  over  2,000,000  dollars,  also  caused  some  little  increased  demand.

The  coinage  at  the  mint  continues  very  small.  For  the  month  of  November  it  has  been  as  follows  :  Deposits.  Coined.  Bars  cast.  Total.

It  is  observable  that  exclusive  of  the  gold  received  from  California,  the  reported  arrivals  and  deposits  at  the  mint  have  been  as  follows,  since  Sept.  1  :-  1852.  1853  Arrived  $12,919,011  .  12,663,122  Deposited  15,673,697  11,129,805  Excess  Receipts  Excess  Deposits  2,754,686  -  The  exports  of  ingots  from  New  York  and  Boston  since  September  have  been  5,782,000  dollars;  a  portion  of  which  went  from  the  California  steamers  to  the  Liverpool  steamers  without  going  to  the  b  o  i  l  .  :  a  lV  s  e  t  s  u  t  ff  e  s  Western  rivers  eina  sen  mint  at  all.  This  i  n  some  d  egree,  accounts  for  the  changed  f  ea  t  ures  o  f  t  h  e  movement.

The  receipts  of  Cotton  at  the  southern  ports  for  the  week  ending  7th  December,  are  78,000  bales  against  113,000  in  the  corresponding  week  last  1,533,317  The  total  receipts  are  Against..  864,000  Falling  off  bales.  .  365,000  And  the  following  week's  return  s  Will  Probably  show  a  deficiency  of  at  least  420,000.  The  exports  for  the  week  to  Great  Britain  are  20,000,  against  54,000  same  week  last  year.  The  total  exports  to  Great  Britain  being  130,000  Against  Falling  off  175,000  The  quantity  of  Cotton  now  at  sea  for  this  port  sums  up  67,350  bales,  against  nearly  200,000  bales  at  same  time  last  year.

The  New  Orleans  Picayune,  of  19th  November,  _  says  :  The  falling  off  in  the  receipts  of  Cotton  at  all  the  ports,  has  now  reached  295,000  bales,  and  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  this  deficiency  will  not  be  made  1113  at  any  time  this  season.  From  the  Atlantic  States  the  advices  in  regard  to  the  damage  done  by  the  frost  of  the  25th  ult.,  are  more  decided  than  ever,  and  under  this  influence  the  crop  esti estimates  mates estimates  from  that  section  are  running  lower  than  before.  There  is  no  question,  also,  that  in  the  region  tributary  to  New  Orleans,  the  plants  have  suffered  greatly  from  the  same  cause,  but  the  extent  of  country  from  which  we  derive  our  supplies  is  so  large  and  diversified,  that  it  becomes  a  diffi difficult  cult difficult  matter  at  this  early  period  to  determine  what  may  be  the  deficit  at  this  point.  But  making  ample  allowance  for  the  increased  breadth  of  the  land  under  cultivation,  and  bearing  in  mind  likewise  the  peculiarities  of  the  season,  as  contrasted  with  last  year,  the  incipient  drought,  and  pro protracted  tracted protracted  summer  and  fall  rains,  and  the  remarkably  early  frost—all  telling  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  present  yield— yieldwe  we yieldwe  cannot  resist  the  conviction  that  the  receipts  of  this  port  will  show  a  material  falling  off,  and  that  hence  the  lower  range  of  estimates  now  prevailing  may  turn  out  to  be  not  far  from  correct.  The  next  intelligence  from  England  will  probably  advise  us  of  the  effect  of  the  frost  accounts  from  this  The  New  Orleans  Price  Current  says:  The  question  of  crop,  which  for  some  time  past  has  been  nearly  lost  sight  of  in  the  more  immediate  pressure  of  other  influences,  seems  now  to  be  assuming  a  position  of  some  prominence  in  the  calculations  of  parties  connected  with  the  trade  in  our  great  staple.  As  we  have  already  re remarked  marked remarked  in  previous  numbers,  the  prospects  up  to  about  the  close  of  August,  as  gathered  from  the  reports  of  the  planters  themselves,  were  considered  quite  flattering  for  a  good  yield,  should  the  picking  season  prove  propitious;  but  unfortu unfortunately  nately unfortunately  the  greater  portion  of  the  month  of  September,  when  dry  weather  was  needed,  proved  unusually  rainy,  and  through  this  cause  picking  was  interrupted  and  delayed,  the  quality  of  the  Cotton  was  injured,  and  the  prospects  of  a  liberal  yield  were  to  some  extent  blighted  by  the  shedding  of  bolls,  the  action  of  the  the  ravages  of  the  worm,  &amp;c.,  which  were  the  consequences  of  excessive  rains.  Since  September,  however,  the  weather  has  been  generally  fa favourable  vourable favourable  for  picking  operations,  but  the  reports  that  now  come  in  of  damage  by  frost,  (of  which,  though  the  backward backwardness  ness backwardness  of  the  first  portion  of  the  season,  and  the  rank  growth  subsequently  caused  by  the  late  rains  the  plant  was  unusually  susceptible)  particularly  in  Tennesse  and  North  Mississippi,  the  region  of  country  tributary  to  Memphis,  and  also  in  North  Alabama,  Arkansas,  &amp;c.,  are  considered  to  be  so  well  vouched  for  that  reduced  estimates  of  the  crop  seem  now  to  be  quite  general,  and,  as  we  have  already  intimated,  appear  to  be  exercising  some  influence  upon  the  operations  of  parties  connected  with  the  trade,  and  also  to  some  extent  upon  prices.  •  lii  respect  to  the  quality  of  the  present  crop,  it  is  generally  admitted  to  be  the  lowest  in  average  of  any  that  has  come  to  market,  at  least  far  many  years  ;  and  in  view  of  the  excessive  proportion  of  low  Cottons  in  the  receipts  thus  far,  and  the  very  limited  demand  for  them,  compared  with  the  better  descriptions,  even  at  an  unusually  wide  difference  in  price,  we  deem  it  not  improper  to  repeat  the  suggestion  which  we  took  the  liberty  to  make  about  a  month  since— sinceviz  viz sinceviz  :  that  it  might  be  well  for  planters,  so  far  as  may  be  in  their  power,  to  handle  the  remainder  of  their  crops  with  a  view  to  quality  as  well  as  quantity.  receipts  at  this  port  since  Ist  September  (exclusive  of  the  arrivals  from  M  o  b  i  l  e,  Flor  i  da,  and  Texas,)  are  269,446  bales,  against  546,490  bales  to  same  date  last  year;  and  the  decrease  in  the  receipts  at  all  the  ports,  up  to  the  latest  dates,  as  compared  with  last  year,  is  353,928  bales.  In  the  exports  from  the  United  States  to  foreign  countries,  as  com compared  pared compared  with  the  same  dates  last  year,  there  is  a  decrease  of  164,663  bales  to  Great  Britain,  15,432  to  France,  and  12,612  to  other  foreign  From  Bombay,  the  following  ships  are  now  duo  with  Cotton  :  LIVERPOOL,  MONDAY  EVENING.  By  the  steamship  Canada,  which  arrived  in  the  river  last  night,  we  have  our  advices  to  the  Bth  inst.,  being  eight  days  later  than  those  previously  received.  The.

In  addi-  tion  to  the  commercial  news  given  in  our  paper  of  to-day,  we  have  but  little  intelligence  of  import  auce.  In  the  grain  market  the  supply  of  wheat  was  not  very  large,  and  the  market  was  said  to  have  been  depressed.
