Derby-buildings,  Fenwick-street,  Liverpool.  FRIDAY.  NOVEMBER  11,  1853  WE  are  enabled  to  give  to-clay  those  Returns  of  Trade  and  Navigation  which  we  were  compelled  to  omit  in  our  publication  of  yesterday,  owing  to  the  crowded  state  of  our  columns.  In  discharge  of  this  duty  we  feel  no  small  pride  and  satisfaction  at  the  strong  testimony  they  bear  to  the  correctness  of  tkose  views  and  opinions  we  have  so  repeatedly  advanced  on  the  subject  of  our  import  and  export  trade.  When  alluding  to  the  fiscal  and  other  monetary  affairs  of  this  country,  we  have  instanced  the  growing  prosperity  of  trade  generally  in  sup sup)ort  )ort sup)ort  of  those  arguments  we  have  used  in  opposition  ,o  the  sudden  interruptions  and  tamperings  with  the  currency  and  circulation  which  have  taken  place  within  the  last  few  months.  The  increased  influx  of  bullion  into  this  market  having  become  a  paramount,  commercial  necessity  with  nearly  all  the  gold  producers,  we  have  contended  that  the  imports  and  exports  of  that  metal  can  no  longer  be  taken  as  a  basis  whereby  we  can  form  anything  like  an  estimate  of  the  actual  stability  or  instabi instability  lity instability  of  trade.  The  only  true  test  we  have  now  remaining  is  the  actual  state  of  production.  If  we  go  on  producing  continuously,  and  receiving  the  productions  of  other  countries  in  exchange  to  the  full  extent  of  our  internal  and  external  demands,  then  trade  and  ommerce  may  be  said  to  be  in  a  prosperous  con-  dition.  And  as  it  is  from  the  excess  of  our  exports  of  production  over  our  imports  of  those  of  other  countries  that  we  derive  our  largest  profit.,  the  tables  under  review  give  a  clearer  insight  into  the  real  condition  of  trade,  than  the  banking  returns  which  show  merely  the  state  of  the  bullion  market  and  the  vast  ramifications  of  the  monetary  trans  actions  of  the  community  at  large  The  aggregate  value  of  our  exports  during  the  first  nine  months  of  the  year  has  been  66,987,7291.,  against  54,391,4381.,  in  the  like  period  of  1852,  showing  an  increase  of  12,597,291/.,  or  upwards  of  23  per  cent.,  which  has  occurred  in  the  following  order  :  Month  ending  Increase.

The  first  daily  provincial  newspaper  ever  published  in  this  country,  to  be  circulating  far  and  wide  for  nearly  two  months,—drawing  forth  encomiums  from  its  London,  Irish,  and  even  American,  con contemporaries—and  temporaries—and contemporaries—and  yet  the  very  Mayor  of  the  town  wherein  it  is  published,  to  be  ignorant  of  the  fact  !!  !  And  this  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  One  Thousand  Eight  Hundred  and  Fifty-three,—when  Mayors  do  read  and  Aldermen  can  sign  their  names  !  Incredible  !  Really  which  believeth  all  can  scarcely  accredit  this.  It  is  always  wise  to  be  prudent.  It  would  appear,  it  was:sometimes  imprudent  to  be  wise  !  i.  e.,  if  one  confess  it.  No  doubt  We  next  find  Lord  JOHN  RUSSELL  on  his  legs,  responding  to  a  toast  in  which  his  Lordship's  name  is  linked  with  every  measure  of  public  improve improvement  ment improvement  and  in  order  to  keep  as  far  away  as  pos possible  sible possible  from  matters  which  interest  the  whole  commercial  community  of  the  United  Kingdom,  he  travels  back  to  the  foundation  of  the  Corpora Corporation  tion Corporation  of  London,  and  concludes  a  remarkably  short  speech,  for  a  leader  of  the  House  of  Commons,  by  stating,  that  he  thought  his  hearers  should  pro proceed  ceed proceed  upon  the  principle  on  which  the  Corporation  was  founded—the  free  election  by  the  citizens  of  their  own  The  next,  and  indeed  the  last,  of  the  Ministers  who  spoke,  was  Viscount  PALMERSTON,  who,  after  dealing  somewhat  facetiously  with  the  American  Minister's  assumed  amazement  at  what  he  saw  before  him,  passes  by  Turkey  and  Russia  as  if  he  had  never  heard  of  those  countries,  and,  being  struck  by  the  galaxy  of  beauty  around  him,  he  calls  on  gentlemen  present,  to  join  him  in  drinking  the  health  of  the  Lady  Mayoress  and  the  Thus  in  these  few  lines  we  have  given  a  perfect  review  of  the  speeches  of  the  Cabinet  Ministers  of  this  country,  who,  although  they  have  not  gone  through  the  mere  form  of  declaring  war,—have  taken  steps  which  nothing  short  of  a  state  of  actual  war  could  justify.  When  the  Peace  Conference  talked  of  peace,  as  a  result  which  might  be  attained  at  any  time  by  the  employment  of  moral  means,  they  were  absolutely  scouted  by  the  most  rabid  of  the  Ministerial  journals,  and  now,  when  our  fleet  is  in  the  'Dardanelles,  merely  waiting  upon  some  trifling  accident  to  bring  it  into  action—while  the  territory  of  an  unoffending  and  allied  power  is  threatened  with  usurpation,  and  while  our  honor,  trade,  and  industry  have  all  been  disregarded  by  the  perfidious  AUTOCRAT,  Lord  ABERDEEN  comes  forward  with  a  second  hand  addition  of  the  whole  duties  of  and  endeavours  to  make  the  world  believe  that  he  is  more  a  peace-man,  than  any  member  of  the  Peace  Congress  itself.  To  exclude  the  Premier  of  Peace  at  a  moment  when  the  country  is  really  at  war,  from  the  castigation  which  was  bestowed  on  the  Congressional  peace peacemakers,  makers, peacemakers,  would  be  acting  unfairly  towards  both.  If  the  arguments  of  the  latter  are  merely  so  many  Ignorance  is  bliss,  'Tis  folly  to  be  and  'twould  be  a  pity  to  disturb  the  calm  quietude  of  mortals  so  disposed  ;  but  we  have  grave  suspi suspicions  cions suspicions  that,  in  the  present  case,  the  language:of  the  jolly  Duke  of  BUCKINGHAM  . STYLE=superscript  to  his  boon  companion,  CHARLES  11.,  would  neither  be  inapplicable  nor  misplaced  :  He  could  know  things  if  he  would  On  the  day  preceding  the  civic  banquet  at  the  Town  Hall,  one  of  the  gentlemen  from  our  office  waited  upon  the  Mayor,  at  his  official  residence,  to  request  the  privilege  in  such  cases  generally  con conferred,  ferred, conferred,  without  being  put  to  the  trouble  of  asking.  His  civic  majesty  then  replied,  that  invitations  had  been  sent  to  the  Courier  and  Mercury;  that  it  would  not  be  convenient  to  extend  them  further,  and  confessed  his  unacquaintance  with  such  a  journal  as  that  gentleman  represented,  until  by  mere  casualty,  on  the  previous  he  had  acquired  the  information  !  The  refusal  of  such  an  ordinary  priVilege  on  the  part  of  the  ex-Mayor  was  most  unusual,  evidently  partial,  and  manifestly  unjust.  Ours  being  a  daily  newspaper  we  could  not,—if  we  would,—copy  the  report  of  the  proceedings  from  our  local  contempo contemporaries,  raries, contemporaries,  and  hence  the  paper  which  possessed  the  intelligence  would  certainly  have  the  advantage  over  our  own.  In  the  metropolis,  the  daily  papers  are  the  most  favored  on  such  occasions.  But  we  only  asked  to  be  placed  precisely  on  an  equality  of  privilege  with  the  other  journals  of  the  town—a  privilege  respectfully  asked  ;  but  very  improperly  denied:  We  had  no  object  in  view  beyond  that  of  serving  the  public—a  most  laudable  one,  truly.  Had  we  received  an  invitation  we  could  not  our ourselves  selves ourselves  have  accepted  it—having  more  important  business  to  perform  than  drinking  and  dancing  a  Mayor  out  of  office—the  most  we  could  have  done,  under  the  circumstances,  would  have  been  to  send  one  of  our  police  reporters,  and  let  him  give  as  graphic  a  description  as  he  was  able  of  Such  a  row,  such  a  rumpus,  and  a  bobbery  though,  probably,  we  may  feel  disposed  to  deck  it  out,  like  the  tale  of  PSYCHE,  with  a  little  meretri meretricious  cious meretricious  ornament  of  our  own,  as  few  things  now-a now-a-days—from  days—from now-a-days—from  Lord  SID-NEE'S  to  a  Mayor's  Soiree,  can  meet  the  public  eye,  in  puris  naturalibus,  without  eliciting  sentiments  anything  but  laudatory.  Nevertheless  there  are  in  the  world,  and  plenty  of  them,  ever  ready  to  observe  carefully,  and  report  fully;  and  LoLLum  SQUINNYIS  .

Thus  has  humbug  been  successful,  and  shadows  and  shams  taken  the  places  of  substances  and  realities.  But  there  is  little  use  in  ta,lking  over  the  past.  The  ex-mayor,  and  his  banquet,  are  of  no  manner  of  importance  to  us  What  is  honour  to  him  who  died  o'  Wednesday  Nor  should  we  have  noticed  either,  were  our  individual  tastes  to  be  consulted.  As  it  is,  we  feel  grieved  that  Liver Liverpool  pool Liverpool  should  have  possessed  a  chief  magistrate,  so  deeply  bound  up  and  interested  in  the  general  progress  and  welfare  of  the  borough,  as  to  be  un unacquainted  acquainted unacquainted  with  one  of  the  main  agencies  calcula calculated  ted calculated  to  promote  them,  although  that  power  had  been  a  considerable  time  in  successful  operation.  But,  better  late  than  and  we  trust  that,  in  the  exercise  of  his  aldermanic  functions  he  will  not  be  so  slow  to  learn,  or  so  dull  to  hear  !  Unfortunately,  it  is  to  be  feared  that,  in  too  many  instances,  public  men  cause  Truth  itself  to  make  court'sy  to  their  will  and  under  the  mask  of  specious  ignorance,  -  would  fain  hide  miserable  party  feelings,  and  contemptible  petty  prejudices.

H.  Brancker  becoming  a  candidate  for  the  representation  of  Abercromby  Ward,  rendered  vacant  by  Mr.  R.  C.  Gardner  having  been  appointed  an  Alderman.  We  are  now,  however,  enabled  to  state  that  Mr.  William  Earle  will  be  the  candidate  in  the  liberal  interest.  A  highly  respectable  and  numerously  at attended  tended attended  meeting  of  the  Electors  of  the  Ward  was  held  last  evening,  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Craig,  Mulberry-street,  when  Mr.  Earle's  candidature  was  unanimously  agreed  upon.  His  address  appears  in  our  advertising  columns,  and  we  have  much  gratification  in  referring  our  readers  to  the  purely  straight straightforward  forward straightforward  and  independent  sentiments  there  enunciated.  We  understand  that  Mr.  Thomas  Lee  is  to  be  brought  forward  by  the  Conservative  party.  In  Pitt-street  Ward  we  leans  that  Mr.  John  Smith  is  to  be  opposed  by  Mr.  William  Mann,  an  ultra  who  comes  forward  under  the  cry  of  the  old  protective  hulk  of  ships,  colonies,  and  his  opponent,  Mr.  Smith,  being,  on  the  other  hand,  captain  of  the  :free-trade  barque,  which  has  brought  prosperity  and  happiness  to  all  classes  in  the  country.  The  elections  will  take  place  on  Saturday.  A  Cabinet  Council  was  held  yesterday  at  the  Foreign  Office,  at  two  o'clock.

It  is  rather  brighter  than  stars  of  the  ninth  magnitude.  This  planet  is  the  ninth  which  I  have  discovered  since  the  commencement  of  a  systematic  search  in  1845,  and  raises  the  number  of  that  extraordinary  group  of  worlds  between  Mars  and  Jupiter  to  27.  VEGETARIAN  BANQUET.—The  members  of  the  Liverpool  Vegetarian  Society  assembled  in  the  Concert-hall,  Lord  Nelson-street,  last  night,  to  partake  of  their  first  vegetarian  dinner  for  the  season.  Mr.  James  Simpson,  president  of  the  society  presided,  and  h  e  was  su  pp  or  t  e  d  by  Mr.  James  Larner,  Framlingham,  Suffolk.

The  exigencies  of  threatrical  life  may  be  judged  from  the  fact,  that  one  of  these  ladies,  who  was  expected  to  be  all  smiles  and  sun 'sunshine'  to  the  world,  was  actually  secretly  mourning  the  loss  of  a  husband,  whose  corpse  was  scarcely  buried.
