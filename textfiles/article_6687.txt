To  China  it  was  Is.,  and  is  Is.  at  the  present  time.  The  most  important  change  in  the  foreign  postage  tariff  was  made  a  week  or  two  ago,  when  the  British  packet  rate-of  postage  to  any  part  of  the  continent,  via  Holland,  was  re reduced  duced reduced  to  4d.  PREVENTION  OP  RAILWAY  Comsfoxs.—Messrs.  Do  an  and  Goddard,  of  Turnwheel  Lane,  Cannon-street,  London,  have  originated  an  invention  with  this  laudable  object  in  view  which  is  thus  described  :—The  inventors  undertake  to  establish,  by  means  of  wires,  a  communication  between  the  different  railway  stations  and  intermediate  distances.  A  wire  connected  with  a  battery  runs  from  the  station  to  the  required  distance,  ono  or  two  miles,  or  further  according  to  circumstances,  where  it  joins  to  bars,  placed  on  each  side  of  the  line,  which  are  charged  with  electricity  ;  while  another  wire  runs  backward  to  the  station,  and  thus  makes  the  communication  complete.  By  means  of  the  usual  signs,  All  and  so  on,  the  station stationmaster  master stationmaster  on  the  one  side,  and  the  engine-driver  of  each  train  on  the  other,  are  apprised  of  the  state  of  the  line  at  any  moment,  and  enabled  to  pursue  the  proper  course.  Con Connected  nected Connected  with  the  bars  is  a  treddle  spring,  which  cannot  fail  to  be  touched  by  any  train  which  passes  over  the  spot,  and  the  action  of  which  is  such  as  to  set  in  motion  bells  at  the  station,  which  continue  ringing  during  the  whole  time  occupied  by  the  passing  of  the  train.  The  signalling  appears  to  be  ar  ranged  that  it  is  next  impossible  for  two  trains  to  enter  at  the  same  time  on  the  intermediate  ground  without  wanton  disreargd  of  duty  on  the  part  of  the  railway  servants  in  charge  of  the  station  or  the  trains.  Mention  was  also  made  yesterday  of  an  apparatus  which  has  been  in  operation  on  the  South  Eastern  railway  for  several  months  ;  the  effect  of  it  being  to  enable  the  station-master  to  prevent  any  train  from  starting  until  a  signal  has  been  received  an  nounc  i  ng  that  the  line  is  clear.  Even  this  appears  well  adapted  to  secure  the  public  against  a  recurrence  of  many  of  the  most  fatal  accidents  recorded  :  but  if  there  are  no  practical  diffi difficulties  culties difficulties  of  an  insurmountable  nature  to  be  urged  against  the  more  recent  and  exact  invention  exhibited  for  the  first  time  yesterday,  the  public  will  have  a  right  to  expect  to  be  saved  from  having  broken  bones,  and  railway  companies  to  be  relieved  from  expenses  for  compensations  and  repairs  which  sometimes  have  a  serious  effect  on  dividends.
