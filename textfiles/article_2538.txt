"fortunate  enough  to  escape  previous  destruction,  their  troubles  and  misfortunes  seem  only  then  to  commence.  In  the  first  place,  the  complaints  of  the  passengers!  for  bad  treatment,  &amp;c.,  on  the  voyage  have  to  be  disposed  of  ;  and  these  instances  are  sometimes  so  gross,  that  in  a  case  occur occurring  ring occurring  only  last  week  the  captain  of  a  vessel  was  fined  in  pe penalties  nalties penalties  amounting  in  cumulo  to  no  less  a  sum  than  £l,BOO.  Such,  one  would  imagine,  whould  be  a  pretty  strong  lesson  for  the  future  selection  of  captains.  And  the  consequences  of  a  bad  choice  are  by  no  means  confined  to  the  passengers'  complaints  ;  for  after  these  have  been  arranged,  then  follow  the  desertion  of  the  seamen—the  landing-  of  the  seamen—:-  the  landing  of  the  goods—the  difficulties  or  lighterage  —the  disputes  as  to  freight  and  other  current  evils—all  occasioned  by  an  incapable  captain,  who  finds  himself  in  a  sea  of  litigation  before  he  has  well  landed,  in  the  midst  of  which  the  freight  is  swallowed  up,  and  the  ship  is  then  detained  in  harbour  till  a  course  of  correspondence  takes  place  between  the  captain  or  agents  and  the  unfortunate  owner,  who  is  thus  severely  punished  for  his  injudicious  selection.  We  have  referred  elsewhere  to  the  particulars  of  our  com commercial  mercial commercial  position,  which  is  one  of  peculiar  interest  at  the  pre present  sent present  moment,  and  therefore  requires  great  caution,  and  dis discrimination  crimination discrimination  in  judging  of  its  real  value;  and  still  more  in  advising  commercial  men  at  a  distance  as  to  how  the  market  is  likely  to  rule  when  the  spring  opens.  The  elasticity  which  the  market  has  already  exhibited  in  receiving  and  disposing  of  such  a  vast  quantity  of  goods  as  have  been  thown  upon  it,  is  really  wonderful;  but  it  appears  to  us  that  great  as  it  really  is,  very  little  is  actually  known  of  the  quantity  and  value  of  the  imports  which  have  poured  in  upon  us.  The  value  of  the  imports  at  the  port  of  Melbourne,  from  various  parts  of  the  world,  for  the  quarter  ended  6th  July,  1853,  was  as  follows:  Imported  in  From  British  ships.

We  should  be  altogether  wanting  in  our  duty,  and  it  would  be  quite  at  variance  with  our  feeling's,  if  we  did  not  notice  the  great  change  for  the  better  wllich  has  taken  place  in  our  steam  communication  with  Britain,  or  even  overlooked  the  great  boon  which  the  Argo  (the  vessel  which  conveys  this  paper)  has  conferred  upon  these  colonies  by  her  recent  splendid  trip,  exhibiting,  as  it  did,  the  superiority  of  steam  as  a  means  of  communication  between  England  and  her  Australian  colonies.  The  feeling  of  our  business  men  towards  the  General  Screw  Steam  Company  is  evinced  by  the  presentation  of  an  address  to  the  directors  of  that  body,  now  in  course  of  signature,  and  which  is  being  signed  by  all  our  leading  firms.  It  is  with  considerable  pleasure  that  we  announce  that  there  is  a  decided  current  of  improvement  in  the  social  con condition  dition condition  of  the  colony.  COMMIROIAL  INTELLIGENCE.  FROM  TUB  ARGUS  OF  AUGUST  18.]  Gold  did  not  come  down  so  largely  last  week  as  the  previous  one,  yet  there  are  indications  of STYLE=superscript  increased  activity  at  the  mines,  and  the  quantity  produced  on  the  whole  has  bean  satisfactory.  The  price  still  rules  at  43  170.  6d.,  though  reduction  is  talked  of.  In  money  and  banking  matters,  last  week  passed  over  very  quietly.  There  are  times  in  co  mmercial  as  well  as  other  matters  w STYLE=superscript  st  h STYLE=superscript  a  e STYLE=superscript  te  n STYLE=superscript  the  no STYLE=superscript  news STYLE=superscript  money  a  go  od  news,  and  therefore  we  refer  to  the  quiet  market  as  an  indication  that  it  is  in  a  more  healthy  position  than  the  fears  of  some  would  lead  them  to  imagine.  Mr.  John  Mackenzie  sold  last  week  the  following  prop  erties  :  Allotment  No.  4,  of  section  36,  North  Melbourne,  for  41,050  ;  four  allotments,  the  residue  of  the  Wedge-shaped  Paddock,  St.  Kilda;  for  4835  ;  quarter-acre  allutuisnt,  Dlalvertt-hill  estate,  £llO  ;  lots  5,6,  and  7  of  Colonel  Anderson's  paddock,  St.  Kilda,  having  126  feet  frontage,  by  102  feet  deep,  at  49  per  foot,  41,080  ;  two  stone  cottages  in  William-street,  near  Brunswick-street,  Collingn  - STYLE=superscript  ood,  of  four  rooms  each,  42,500,;  the  Tragowell  station,  Lower  Loddon,  the  property  of  Messrs.  C.  and  J.  Rradshaw,  with  2,000  cattle  and  10,  000  sheep,sthe  former  at  46,  and  the  latter  at  41  per  head,  amounting  to  422,000,  stores  and  sundries  to  be  valued—purchasers,  Messrs.  Booth  and  Holloway;  297  acres,  being  the  unsold  portion  of  the  Knoll  Estate,  section  3,  Doutto.  Galls,  at  .t'll4  9s.  7d.  per  acre,  amounting  to  £34,000.  This  and  the  previous  sales,  in  subdivided  lots,  at  4200  and  4300  per  acre,  have  realised  to  the  proprietor,  William  Fletcher,  Esq.,  the  sum  of  4411,000.  MELBOURNE  GOLD  h  CIRCULAR.  The  demand  for  gold  for  shipment  by  the  Argo,  has  continued  during  the  week,  and  a  large  amount  of  business  has  been  done.  The  prices  continued  firm,  at  17s.  6d.  The  latest  information  from  the  different  fields  is  as  follows  :  From  Balaarat,  the  oldest  of  our  gold  fields,  some  astonishing  lumps  of  gold  have  turned  up.  From  Bendigo,  matters  are  progressing  steadly.  From  liVlvor,  nearly  ail  the  diggers  have  left  for  the  Gouiurn  ;  but  a  further  confirmation  of  its  productiveness  has  yet  to  be  received.  From  Koran  all  the  diggers  have  gone,  and  the  storekeepers  are  following.  At  the  Ovens  matters  are  going  on  pretty  steadily,  the  quantity  coming  to  Melbourne  being  rather  over  that  sent  to  Sidney.  It  is  with  satisfaction  we  notice  the  stea.iy:increase  now  going  on  in  the  amount  brought  down  by  escort.  Several  vessels  have  arrived  from  Britain  lately,  in  which  there  is  no  specie  reported.  We  observe  an  appointment  lately  made,  of  an  Aisay  Master  for  this  colony.  We  do  not  exactly  know  where  the  gold  is  to  come  fr  - STYLE=superscript  om  for  excercising  the  functions  of  such  an  officer,  According  to  our  experience,  we  feel  certain  that  the  diggers  as  a  class  pefer  re receiving  ceiving receiving  a  definite  amount  for  their  gold  dnst,  rather  than  resort  to  the  expedient  of  having  it  melted  and  assayed,  as  that  involves  a  delay  and  uncertainty  as  to  its  value,  which  they  will  not  risk.  We  cannot  see  any  other  :mode  of  fully  occupying  the  lately-ap lately-appointed  pointed lately-appointed  official  than  by  an  Government  extending  the  establishment  a  degree  further,  anu  opening  a  bullion  broker's  office.
