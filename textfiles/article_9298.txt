It  is  to  be  regretted  that  we  have  among  the  Employers  of  Liver Liverpool,  pool, Liverpool,  men  who,  in  dealing  with  those  in  their  employ,  violate  every  Trade  Regulation,  whilst,  on  the  other  hand,  they  profess,  through  the  medium  of  the  newspapers  printed  by  them,  to  be  the  strenuous  upholders  of  the  true  interests  of  'he  sons  of  toil.  As  we  judge  of  men  by  th.ir  actions,  and  not  by  the  utterance  they  may  give  to  cer certain  tain certain  sentiments,  we  respectfully  make  this  app  to  ourow-  workmen,  and  call  up  in  them  to  'thew  their  utter  eal STYLE=superscript  contempt  feenob  hypocritical  cant,  by  ceasing  to  purchase  newspapers  not  found  in  the  subjoined  list.

We  are  not  ignorant  of  the  favourite  statement  used  by  many  of  the  working  classes  with  regard  to  this  batter,  that  the  work  so  done  is  at  a  cheap  rate.
