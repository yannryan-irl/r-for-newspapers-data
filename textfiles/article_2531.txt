"MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL  LIVERPOOL,  FRIDAY  EVENING.  THE  foreign  and  colonial  produce  markets  being  more  directly  influenced  than  almost  any  other,  by  the  monetary  movements  of  this  country,  we  would  direct  the  attention  of  the  trade  gene generally  rally generally  to  the  importations  of  bullion  which  have  been  reported  within  the  last  month  in  the  columns  of  the  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES.  The  influx  of  gold  for  the  week  ending  this  day,  amounts  to  £3,382,221,  while  the  exports  for  the  same  period  do  not  amount  to  1,000,000,  and  if  we  add  the  quantitity  of  gold  at  sea.,  as  reported  in  our  paper  of  Wednesday  last,  to  that  actually  received  up  to  this  date,  the  aggregate  amount  will  be  no  less  than  £3,991,621,  which  leaves  the  excess  of  imports  over  the  exports  something  more  than  £2,996,621.  Of  the  bullion  exported,  £234,330  consisted  of  silver  ;  therefore,  if  we  add  thiS  amount  to  the  surplus  of  gold  imported,  we  find  the  amount  of  gold  imported  and  retained  in  the  country  is  £3,230,951.  If.this  vast  increase  in  the  importa importations  tions importations  of  the  precious  metals  had  in  any  way  re retarded  tarded retarded  the  imports  of  otker.products,  their  effects  would  prove  most  disastrous  to  the  community  at  large  ;  but  coming  as  they  do,  as  an  addition  to  the  ordinary  supplies  of  the  necessaries  of  life,  they  must  become  a  source  of  increased  commercial  prosperity,  and  enlarged  consumption.  Opposed  to  the  general  good,  and  a  probable  advan9e  in  prices,  to  be  anticipated  from  the  present  state  of  the  bullion  market,  we  have  the  rumoured  com commencement  mencement commencement  of  hostilities  in  the  East,  Should  this  rumour  turn  out  to  be  true,  it  would  be  impossible  to  form  any  idea  of  the  course  trade  will  take.  By  the  Argo,  which  arrived  at  Plymouth  late  last  .night  from  Port  Philip,  after  a  passage  of  64  days  only,  we  have  Australian  advices  to  the  24th  of  August,  which  is  about  27  days  later  than  those  brought  by  the  Eagle.  The  intelligence  brought  via  Singapore  and  Marseilles  will  have  been  antici anticipated  pated anticipated  by  nearly  a  week  by  the  arrival  of  the  Argo,  which  brings  in  addition  to  a  very  heavy  mail,  no  less  than  134,444  ounces  of  gold,  worth  about  £537,776.  Her  advices  speak  of  the  discovery  of  new  gold  fields.  She  reports  the  sailing  of  the  steamer  Cleopatra  from  Adelaide  on  the  Ist  of  August,  and  the  arrival  of  the  Victoria  at  Port  Philip  after  a  passage  of  61days.  The  commercial  intelligence  brought  by  the  Argo  will  be  found  in  extenso  in  another  column.  The  Liverpool  Cotton  Market  continued  firm  from  the  opening  to  the  closing  of  the  week.  The  daily  sales  amounted  to  about  6000  bales  Surats  were  in  demand,  but  without  any  advance  in  price.  The  quantities  sold  were  27,520  to  the  trade,  with  4,800  Bales  for  export  and  on  speculation:  The  sales  of  other  sorts  were—Americans,  3,570,  and  Egyptians,66o  bales.  The  actual  exports  con consist  sist consist  of  1450  Americans,  80  Brazils,  and  700  East  Indian.  Total,  2108  bales.  The  gross  imports  for  the  week  amount  to  21,942  bales.  In  our  Corn  Market,  flour  ruled  6d.  per  barrel,  and  is.  per  sack  higher  than  our  last  quotations-  The  trade  are  acting  with  great  caution  and  little  speculation,  of  any  kind,  can  be  said  to  be  going  on.  _  .  _  0  CJ  -  In  the  Foreign  and  Colonial  Produce  Markets,  business  has  been  a  little  more  active  than  it  was  last  week.  For  Sugars  and  Teas  there  has  been  an  active  demand,  while.  Coffees,  partacularly,jamaica,  have  been  flat.  -  The  Share  Market  has  been  dull  to-day,  and  closed  a  shade  lower  than  yesterday  ;  but  without  any  remarkable  feature.  .  Owing  to  the  extraordinary  pressure  on  our  space,  caused  by  the  arrival  of  intelligence  from  the  seat  of  war,  and  Australia,  we  must  iefer  to  our  ordinary  quotations  in  another  column.
