"have  greater  confidence  of  good  results  :  without  it  I  am  certain  we  must  look  for  disappointment.  In  Liverpool,  a  marine  reformatory,  if  judiciously  conducted,  would  be  sure  to  possess  this  advantage.  In  the  course  of  my  examination  before  the  select  committee  on  juvenile  crime,  I  put  forth  this  amongst  other  remedial  suggestions,  and  the  proposals  seemed  to  meet  with  favour.  The  success  which  has  attended  the  Marine  Society's  opera operations  tions operations  in  connection  with  their  training  ship  at  Woolwich  puts  the  practibility  of  such  an  undertaking  beyond  a  ques question;  tion; question;  and  the  admitted  scarcity  of  seamen,  and  the  falling  off  in  the  supply  for  future  years,  arising  from  a  combina combination  tion combination  of  several  causes,  seem  to  point  out  such  a  step  as  no  less  politic  than  benevolent.  â€¢  There  is  no  place  in  the  king kingdom  dom kingdom  where  such  an  experiment  as  I  would  urge  is  so  likely  to  succeed  as  in  Liverpool,  and  it  is  undeniable  that  there  is  none  more  loudly  calling  for  the  effort.  Let  it  not  be  longer  alleged  that  reformatory  efforts  act  as  a.  premium  on,  or  an  inducement  to,  crime.  I  have  cer certainly  tainly certainly  heard  of  one  solitary  instance,  said  to  have  occurred  14  years  ago  '  and  that  one  unauthenticated,  whe  r  ei  n  it  was  supposed  tat  such  danger  presented  itself;  but  my  own  expe experience  rience experience  here  goes  to  prove  directly  the  contrary,  and  within  the  period  embraced  by  this  report  even,  I  can  point  to  several  cases  wherein  both  parents  and  the  children  themselves  have  de declined  clined declined  to  embrace  the  assistance  offered  on  the  condition  of  being  placed  in  reformatory  institutions,  preferring,  in  some  instances,  to  remain  in  prison,  even  for  lengthened  periods,  that  they  might  on  discharge,  return  to  their  former  courses  and  haunts,  rather  than  submit  to  the  wholesome  discipline  of  a  reformatory  process.---I  have  the  honour  to  be,  gentle gentlemen,  men, gentlemen,  your  very  obedient  servant,  THOMAS  CARTER,  Chaplain."
