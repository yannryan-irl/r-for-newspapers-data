"MANCHESTER.  AN  ELECTIONEERING  FRAcAs.—Yesterday  morning,  at  the  Salford  Borough  Court,  Mr.  William  Christian  Joughin,  of  the  Crooked  Billet  public-house,  Chapel-street,  Salford,  appeared  in  answer  to  a  charge  of  assault  preferred  against  him  by  Mr.  William  Taylor,  pawnbroker,  Greengate.  Mr.  J.  H.  Taylor,  solicitor,  was  for  the  defendant.  The  complainant  stated  that  on  last  Tuesday  afternoon  he  was  engaged,  in  com company  pany company  with  Mr.  Brunton,  draper,  Victoria-bridge,  in  canvassing  the  burgesses  in  Trinity  ward,  in  favour  of  Messrs.  Marsden  and  Eveleigh.  Between  three  and  six  o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  he  was  going  up  Collier-street  in  the  company  of  two  females  and  their  husbands.  They  were  Mrs.  Williams  and  Mrs.  Brown.  ,They  had  got  close  to  the  Rolla  public-house,  in  Collier-street,  when  complainant  saw  a  car  standing  in  the  street,  which  contained  three  or  four  men,  and  Mr.  Hopkinson,  one  of  the  candidates  on  the  other  side,  was  standing  close  to  the  horse's  head.  Mr.  Hopkinson,  was  arranging,  as  witness  thought,  the  gearing  of  the  horse,  and  as  ho  turned  opposite  to  him,  Mr.  Hopkinson  turned  his  head  round,  and  asked  in  a  good-humoured  way  how  the  voting  was  going  on.  This  con conversation  versation conversation  drew  the  attention  of  the  defendant  who  was  sand sanding  ing sanding  on  the  ear.  The  moment  defendant  saw  him  he  called  him  a  rascal,  or  scoundrel.  Witness  took  no  notice  of  that  and  went  on.  The  defendant  continued  using  his  offensive  language,  and  at  length,  when  he  was  about  to  pass  him,  he  shouted  out  at  the  top  of  his  voice,  in  the  presence  of  all  who  were  about,  you  are  a  disgraceful  Witness  then  told  him'  that  he  considered  hint  a  blackguard.  He  was  then  passing  on  the  flags  without  giving  any  further  reply  to  the  defendant,  when  in  the  greatest  fury  he  jumped  out  of  the  car  and  exclaimed,  what  do  you  say?  what  do  you  ran  across  the  street,  and  came  at  witness  in  a  furious  and  savage  manner.  He  came  with  his  open  hand  and  gave  witness  a  blow  on  the  throat,  and  knocking  him  backwards  a  yard  or  two  towards  the  wall  ;  lie  knocked  his  hat  off  and  caught  him  by  the  throat  till  witness  could  neither  speak  nor  breathe,  and  while  he  held  him  by  the  throat,  he  struck  him  on  the  head.  lie  continued  to  swear,  made  use  of  desperate  expressions,  and  was  about  to  strike  him  in  the  face,  when  Mr.  Hopkinson  came  up,  laid  hold  of  the  defendant's  arm,  and  entreated  him  to  desist.  The  defendant  was  rather  fresh,  as  he  was  that  morning  in  Court.  Cross  examined.—He  was  not  assisting  in  bottling  some  voters  whom  the  defendant  wanted.  The  defendant  was  one  of  the  Committee  of  Mr.  Hopkinson,  who  was  returned.—Mr.  Hopkinson,  the  newly-elected  councillor  for  St.  Stephen's  ward,  stated  that  he  remembered  the  previous  Tuesday.  'Mr.  Taylor  came  up  while  he  was  in  Collier  street,  and  shook  his  fist  at  Mr.  Joughin,  and  called  him  a  villainous  scoundrel.  Taylor  came  up  the  street,  when  witness  was  about  ten  yards  from,the  cart.  Witness  asked  Taylor  how  the  polling  was  getting  on,  upon  which  Taylor  called  Joughin  a  --  villainous  scoundrel.  Heard  nothing  pass  between  them  before  that.  If  anything  had  passed,  thinks  he  should  have  heard  it.  Upon  this  Joughin  collared  Taylor,  and  asked  him  what  he  meant  by  calling  him  by  the  name  he  applied  to  him.  Witness  immediately  interposed  between  them.  Joughin  merely  took  hold  of  Taylor's  coat  collar,  he  did  not  strike  him.—Other  witnesses  having„,  been  examined,  in  corrobora corroboration  tion corroboration  of  the  statements  made,  Mr.  Taylor,  solicitor,  addressed  the  bench  for  the  defendant  ;  after  which,  Mr  Trafford  said,  it  was  clear  that  an  assault,  and  rather  a  violent  assault  had  been  committed,  and  that,  too,  by  one  who  had  been  frequently  before  that  Court  for  the  commission  of  violence  in  one  shape  or  another,  towards  people.  And  his  conduct  that  morning  in  coming  into  the  Court  i❑  a  state  far  from  sober,  was  exceed exceedingly  ingly exceedingly  disgraceful.  He  must  pay  a  fine  of  40s.  and  costs,  BANKRUPTS.  From  the  London  Gazettee  of  last  night.  Robert  Wyburn,  cabinet  maker,  Taunton,  Somerset.  BANKRUPTS.

By  advice,  from  New  York  of  the  25th  ult.,  the  market  is  quoted  25c.  per  barrel  down  for  flour,  and  2  to  3c.  per  bushel  lower  for  wheat.  The  exports  thence  for  the  week  were  as  follows,  viz.:  of  flour  to  Liverpool  10,842  barrels,  to  Havre  17,966  barrels;  of  wheat  to  Liverpool  207,376  bushels,  to  London  8,554  bushels,  to  Cardiff  14,099  bushels,  to  Havre  64,874  bushels,  to  Lisbon  21,686  bushels.  The  receipt  of  grain  into  this  port  from  Ireland,  since  Tues Tuesday  day Tuesday  last,  arc  moderate,  those  of  oatmeal  including  a  further  good  supply,  while  coastwise  the  entries  are  altogether  trivial.  Of  wheat  from  abroad,  however,  the  import  of  the  week  is  liberal,  chiefly  from  the  United  States,  and  partly  from  Canada,  Spain,  Egypt,  and  Constantinople;  of  States  and  Spanish  flour  the  arrivals  are  also  fair  in  amount,  which,  with  a  parcel  of  barley  and  two  or  three  of  Indian  corn,  from  the  supplies  of  foreign  produce  fresh  in  for  to-day.  The  weather  having  continued  favourable  here,  and  through throughout  out throughout  most  parts  of  this  country  during  the  last  ten  days,  great  noires,  anoears  to  have  been  made  the  last  week  towards  se securing  curing securing  the  remnant  of  tile  Mt  wherever  the  absorption  of  the  late  rains  admitted  of  it;  whilst  in  some  districts  in  Ireland  the  weather  last  week  was  extremely  wet  and  unpropitious,  and  all  agricultural  operations  necessarily  suspended  at  the  time.  The  markets  of  the  king kingdom  dom kingdom  are  generally  quoted  lower,  and  the  trade  dull,  the  appre apprehension  hension apprehension  of  a  bad  seeding  time  being  in  some  measure  dissipated,  and  an  impression  gaining  ground  that  the  wants  of  the  season  will  be  fairly  supplied  :  the  future  can  only  show  how,  with  a  failing  crop  of  wheat  at  home,  an  equally  deficient  one  in  France,  and  the  difficulties  caused  by  the  complicated  state  of  political  affairs  in  the  East,  independent  of  the  high  rates  of  transport,  our  necessities  can  be  fully  and  regularly  met  up  to  next  harvest;  millers,  however,  having  lately  well  supplied  their  wants,  and  in  the  face  of  a  present  good  supply  are  naturally  cautious,  and  Mark-lane  giving  a  depressed  account  yesterday,  our  market  this  morning  opened  with  a  dull  aspect;  there  was,  however,  little  pressure  on  the  part  of  holders,  and  having  a  tolerable  attendance  of  town  and  country  millers,  a  moderate  business  was  transacted  in  wheat,  generally  at  Fri Friday's  day's Friday's  decline,  say  3d.  per  bushel  under  the  rates  of  this  day  week.  The  flour  trade  commenced  equally  slow,  but  before  the  close  an  active  demand  sprang  up,  with  an  improving  value,  and  a  considerable  quantity  changed  hands,  the  general  currency  for  fresh  American  being  Is.  per  barrel  less  than  on  Tuesday  last,  and  there  are  now  few  sellers.  In  bailey  we  have  little  change  from  the  end  of  the  week  ;  most  of  the  new  Irish  parcels  are  of  middling  quality  and  only  the  best  bring  our  quotations.  Malt  fully  supports  the  late  value.  Beans  are  a  slow  sale.  Oats  are  dull,  but  oatmeal  is  in  somewhat  better  request,  at  a  further  slight  decline.  .  For  Indian  corn  we  have  continued  inquiry,  but  the  firm firmness  ness firmness  of  holders  still  prevents  much  business  being  done.
