"gorreVottlinut.  TO  THE  EDITOR  OF  THE  LIVERPOOL  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES  Liverpool,  28th  Oct.,  1853  SIR—We  feel  ourselves  compelled  to  contradict,  publicly,  a  malignant  statement  made  by  Mr.  Neale,  Secretary  to  '  the  Shipwrights'  Association,  at  a  meetino.:o  that  body  on  Wednesday  last,  which  statement  is  calculated  to  do  us  a  serious  injury.  Below,  we  give  a  copy  of  the  wages  account  for  the  vessel  referred  to  by  Mr.  Neale.  In  this  statement  the  men  who  worked  at  the  ship  will  find  their  names,  time,  and  the  amounts  paid  to  them.  At  the  comple completion  tion completion  of  the  work,  the  owner  of  the  vessel  and  ourselves  considered  it  well  done  ,  and  as  we  give  the  men  credit  for  bein  g  honest,  we  appeal  to  the  men  to  check  our  account,  by  which  means  the  absurdity  of  Mr.  Neale's  pretensions  to  check  labour  accounts,  will  be  discovered,  and  if  he  does  not  consider  it  his  duty  to  make  an  apology  to  us,  and  to  the  men  who  worked  at  the  ship,  and  who  we  consider  he  has  equally  slandered  (for  if  his  statement  that  the  work  should  not  cost  more  than  £5O  were  correct,  then  the  men  had  not  done  a  fair  day's  work  for  a  fair  day's  wages)  he  most  certainly  deserves  the  strictest  censure  of  the  Ship Shipwrights'  wrights' Shipwrights'  Association,  who  are  unfortunate  in  having  a  Secretary  capable  of  making  such  palpable  misstatements,  which  must,  undoubtedly,  rflect  the  greatest  discredit  on  themselves.  _  _  _  As  a  proof  of  the  feelings  which  appear  to  influence  the  actions  of  the  Secretary,  we  may  mention,  that  the  letter  which  he  read  at  the  meeting,  was  surreptitiously  obtained  from  our  office.
