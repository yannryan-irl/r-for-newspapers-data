"RUSSIA  WITH  SHIPS  OF  WAR.  The  follO;ringT;frOnctieisi.  B.  Mail  of  Thursday  :  understand  that  an  official  letter  from  Lord  Palmer Palmerston,  ston, Palmerston,  as  Secretary  for  the  Home  Department,  has  been  received  this  week  by  our  civic  authorities,  requesting  to  know  particulars  respecting  some  war  steamers  which  his  lordship  was  informed  were  building  on  the  Clyde  for  the  Emperor  of  Russia.  His  lordship  has,  we  believe,  been  misinformed  on  the  subject,  as  there  are  no  ships  building  here  for  the  Czar;  but  there  are  at  present  being  constructed  two  pairs  of  powerful  first-class  marine  engines  and  pachinery  for  war  steamers,  by  one  of  our  first  engineers,  !who  is  under  contract  to  have  them  at  Cronstadt  in  April,  'Aid  to  fit  them  up  in  the  vessels  there  by  his  awn  workmen.  i  e  llthough_tbere  are  no  ships  building  here  for  the  Autocrat,  iwe  hare  reason  to  believe  that  his  lordship  off  learn  some-  Wing  on  the  subject  if  he  institutes  inquiries  on  the  banks  of  `the  Tyne  or  Wear.  This  step  on  the  part  of  Lord  Palmerston  would  indicate  a  firmer  policy  towards  that  aggressive  power  than  has  hitherto  characterised  the  pro proceedings  ceedings proceedings  of  government  since  the  present  Eastern  difficulty"
