"THE  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES  AMERICA.  ARRIVAL  OF  THE  STEAMER  ANDES  The  screw  steam-ship  Andes,  under  the  command  of  Captain  Moodie,  arrived  here  yesterday,  at  two  o'clock,  from  New  York,  after  a  passage  of  twelve  days  and  a  half  ;  by  her  we  have  re received  ceived received  our  usual  files  of  papers,  which  aro  three  days  later  than  those  previously  to  hand.  The  paddle  steamer,  Washington,  for  _  South Southampton,  ampton, Southampton,  sailed  from  New  York  on  the  same  . STYLE=superscript  day.  The  Arabia,  from  LiverpOol,  arrived  out  at  New  York  on  the  morning  of  the  eth  inst.,  at  half-past  nine  o'clock,  with  advices  from  Liverpool  to  the  24th  of  September.  The  Andes  has  brought  home  150,000  dollars  in  specie,  and  11  passengers.  The  advice's  from  Liverpool  by  the  Arabia,  had  caused  a  further  excitement  in  the  New  York  Markets  for  flour  and  bread  stuffs,  and  given  an  immense  impetus  to  speculation.  The  trans transactions  actions transactions  are  reported  as  very  large  at  a  further  advance  of  121  cent  per•  barrel  upon  flour,  whilSt  wheat  was  held  very  firm  at  the  previous  quota-  tions.  The  amount  of  business  going  forward  was  only  restricted  by  the  scarcity  of  vessels  to  send  it  to  Europe,  and  in  consequence  freights  had  further  advanced.  The  last  quotations  were  for  wheat  to  Liverpool  ls.  3d.,  and  for  flour,  from  3s.  9d.  to  4s,  per  barrel.  To  London  ls.  6d.  was  demanded  for  wheat,  and  ss.  for  flour.  The  Stock  Market  had  been  rather  unfavourably  affected  by  the  European  news,  as  will  be  seen  by  reference  to  our  market  report  annexed.  There  had  been  no  important  change  in  the  money  market,  but  the  demand  was  rather  more  active  at  7  - STYLE=superscript  per  cent  interest.  There  was  only  a  limited  enquiry  for  Exchange  on  London,  but  the  quota quotations  tions quotations  were  firm  at  1091  to  110.  The  Washington  Union  publishes  a  summary  of  the  cruise  of  the  fishing  squadron  under  Commo Commodore  dore Commodore  Shubrielc  The  following  summary  of  his  re  port  affords  another  illustration  of  that  reckleSs reckleSsness  ness reckleSsness  in  circulating  reports  and  stories,  of  which  the  community  have  such  just  reason  to  complain  single  case  of  detention  came  to  the  knowledge  of  the  commander  of  the  squadron,  and  that  was  promptly  inquired  into  at  Charlotte  Town,  where  the  fishing  schooner  was  sent  and  tried.  •  It  was  found  that  the  vessel  was  taken  in  flagrant  viola•  tion  of  the  first  article  of  the  treaty  of  1818,  and  was  liberated,  after  having  been  libelled,  on  the  written  acknowledgment  of  the  master  that  he  was  so  taken,  and  on  his  agreement  to  pay  some  small  expenses  incurred  in  the  suit.  phis  is  the  plain,  unvarnished  story,  of  the  Starlight,  Captain  McDonald,  of  which  has  been  so  grossly  exaggerated  in  the  newspapers.  And  it  is  the  only  case  of  detention  that  has  occurred  this  year.

He  says  that  no  family  where  the  fever  enters  escapes  without  the  loss  of  some  of  its  members  ;  and  he  named  seve several  ral several  instances  where  almost  the  whole  family  was  swept  of  In  one  of  fifteen  persons,  fourteen  died;  in  another  of  eight,  seven  died  ;  and  so  on  in  the thesame  same thesame  proportion  in  smaller  A  letter  dated  at  Montgomery,  Alabama,  reports  the  fever  as  unabated,  and  the  citizens  rapidly  leaving.  At  Pensacola  the  epidemic  •continues  to  show  a  favourable  decrease,  while  at  Milton,  Flo Florida,  rida, Florida,  it  is  raging  to  considerable  extent.  Accounts  from  Port  Gibson  represent  whole  families  as  down  with  the  fever,  and  no  nurses  to  attend  them.  There  was  but  six  physicians  in  the  place.  Among  the  more  recent  victims  at  Port  Gibson,  is  the  proprietor  of  the  Herald.  At  Washington,  LEL,  there  are  not  persons  enough  left  to  bury  the  dead.

The  Governor  says  It  will  become  my  duty  to  guard  and  protect,  as  far  as  lays  in  my  power,  the  interests  of  each  elilzen,  anti  V,  act:  aw,t,  first  will  at  all  times  afford  me  pleasure,  and  the  latter  may  at  times  become  an  irksome  and  painful  duty,  but  it  is  one  which  must  be  performed  at  every  hazard.

To  accomplish  this  end,  however,  it  becomes  necessary  that  there  should  be  a  united  and  harmonious  action  on  the  part  of  the  several  departments  of  the  Terli Terlitorial  torial Terlitorial  Government,  as  well  as  the  militaly  power  of  the  General  Government  stationed  here  ;  and,  above  all,  that  we  should  receive,  on  all  proper  oc occasions,  casions, occasions,  the  cordial  support  of  the  community  at  'large.&#34;  Advices  from  Richmond,  Virginia,  say  the  tobacco  crop  on  Staunton  river,  Va.,  is  seriously  injured  by  the  frost.  From  Buffalo  we  learn  that  the  schooner  Oneida*  had  been  run  down  on  Lake  Erie  by  the  steamer  Buck  Eye  State,  when  about  twelve  miles  off  Buffalo.  She  had  on  board  a  cargo  of  7,000  bushels  wheat.

The  state  warrant  charges  them  with  inciting  to  riot,  or  in  some  form  violating  the  state  laws  in  their  efforts  to  arrest  the  fugitives.  NEW  YORK  MARKETS,  OCTOBER  7.  STOCKS.—The  foreign  news  was  not  favourably  received  in  the  street,  althouglithe  changes  were  not  very  important.  The  cheaper  class  6f  stocks  was  considerably  depressed.
