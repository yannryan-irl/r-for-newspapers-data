The  Boston  Daily  Advertiser,  of  the  26th  ultimo  received  by  the  Canada,  contains  the  following  which  it  had  received  by  telegraph  :  ARRIVAL  OF  THE  NORTHERN  LIGHT  Fifteen  Days  later  from  California  NORFOLK,  Oct.  25.—The  steam-ship  Northern  Light,  from  San  Juan  de  Nicarague  for  New  York,  put  in  here  to-day  for  coal  and  provisions.  She  brings  San  Francisco  dates  to  the  Ist  inst.,  and  700  passengers,  together  with  one  and  a  half  millions  of  dollars  in  gold.
