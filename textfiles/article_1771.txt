In Indeed  deed Indeed  we  could  expect  nought  else  froth  so  talented  an  Editor  as  Mr.  Harrison  Ainsworth,  whose  literary  labors  cannot  be  well  over-rated  by  the  reading  public.  The  present  number  opens  with  a  paper  on  The  Military  Resources  of  Russia,  which  at  this  particular  time  is  quite  apropos.  After  :  referring  to  ,  the  reign'  of  Peter  the  Great,  when  only  one  boat  constituted  the  nucleus  for  a  fleet,  and  one  company  of  soldiers--the  Potiaschni  who  mounted  guard  at  the  palace  of  Moscow— Moscowformed  formed Moscowformed  a  nucleus  for  the  enormous  army  since  created.  The  writer  enters,  perhaps  rather  tedi tediously,  ously, tediously,  into  an  account  of  .  the  standing  naval  and  military  armaments  of  Russia  ;  employing  a  minut4e  of  detail,  which,  however  interesting  to  the  readers  of  the  United  Service  Magazine,  is  not  likely  to  find  favour  with  those  less  skilled  in  military  tactics.  However,  the  following'  observa observations  tions observations  on  Russia  and  her  policy  will  not  fail  to  Augustine,  Aspedo,  A.  Durante  Jr  Co.,  Sept.  I  interest  27  c  upon  in  a  purely  ethnographical  point  of  view  Russia,  from  the  tendencies  of  its  predominant  race,  and  the  great  majority  of  those  who  are  allied  to  it,  would  appear  to  be  destined  by  nature  to  constitute  a  pacific  nation  of  in industrious  dustrious industrious  and  commercial  habits,  of  peasants  and  herds,  rather  than  a  military  nation  called  upon  to  domineer  over  the  world.  What  a  pity  that  the  successive  heads  of  such  a  nation  should  have  mistaken  their  mission  !  Even  in  most  cases  De  Hathausan  will  have  it  Russia  has  as  yet  only  fought  on  the  defensive  side  ;  and  in  the  case  of  the  Poles  and  the  Tartan,  he  argues,  that  tha  restless  warrior  races  should  be  subjected  by  a  more  powerful  nation!  Let  us  hope  that  this  is  the  case  also  with  regard  to  the  position  of  Russia  and  Western  Europe,  although  it  is  evident  that  Hathausen  himself  is  in  momentary  dread  of  an  advance  of  the  Russians  into  the  heart  of  Germany  ;  but  even  if  so,  it  certainly  is  not  the  case  with  regard  to  the  position  of  Russia  in  relation  to  Turkey.  The  possession  of  Constanti Constantinople,  nople, Constantinople,  the  resuscitation  of  the  Greek  worship  at  St.  Sophia,  and  the  holding  the  keys  of  the  Bosphorus  and  of  the  Dar Dardanelles,  danelles, Dardanelles,  is  an  undying  tradition  with  the  Russian,  be  he  Tsar,  or  be  he  serf.  Nor  with  inflexible  perseverance  opposed  to  a  degenerate  semi-barbarious  race,  and  the  erro erroneous  neous erroneous  policy  of  Western  nations  in  opposing  themselves  to  the  enormous  power  of  Russia,  instead  of  availing  themselves  of  the  obstacles  presented  by  the  intervening  principali principalities  ties principalities  of  the  Danube,  will  the  day  of  success  be  long  Next  follows  a  succint,  lively,  and  anecdotical  sketch  of  the  Russian  soldiery,  as  well  as  the  terri terrible  ble terrible  thraldom  to  which  they  are  subjected.  But  strange  as  this  description  of  military  life  in  Russia  is,  it  would  be  stranger  far,  were  we  told  that  a  milder  and  freer  regime  prevailed  under  Muscovite  despotism  the  Russian  army  is  recruited  like  that  of  other  nations,  from  vagabonds,  idlers,  and  bad  subjects,  more  particularly  malefactors  and  criminals,  it  is  still  acknowledgedly  deeply  imbued  with  religious  feeling.  The  strange  way  in  which  ideas  of  God,  of  the  Tsar,  and  of  the  country,  are  mixed  up  together  in  the  mind  of  the  Russian  boor,  ensure  an  enthusiasm  in  the  soldiery,  as  great  almost  as  that  which  inspired  the  first  followers  of  Muhammad.  If  the  Russian  does  not  fight  from  any  chivalrous  inspiration,  he  fights  for  his  God  and  the  Tsar,  for  the  love  of  Holy  Russia,  and  the  Russian  nationality.  As  was  the  case  with  the  Jews  in  olden  time,  the  Russians  are  strongly  imbued  with  the  religious  conviction  that  they  are  the  chosen  of  God.  The  stoicism  shown  by  the  Russian  soldier  in  the  hour  of  danger,  rests  on  his  deep  faith  in  his  mission,  and  the  celestial  reward  that  awaits  him.  These  religious  senti sentiments,  ments, sentiments,  and  the  character  of  the  Slavonian  nationality,  also  produce  a  marked  antipathy  for  all  that  is  foreign—an  an antipathy  tipathy antipathy  which  is  one  of  the  great  features  of  Muscovite  cha character,  racter, character,  and  which  tends,  no  doubt,  to  fortify  the  military  spirit..  The  Slavonian  elasticity,  the  vanity  and  pliability,  the  spirit  of  association,  and  the  very  physical  aptitudes  of  the  Russians,  furnish  materials  for  what  is  called,  in  its  ensemble,  esprit  de  corps.  subjection  of  the  Russian  soldiers  is  so  perfect,  that  it  is  impossible  to  contemplate  anything  more  uniform  than  Russian  troops.  Their  dress,  their  march?  their  manners,  nay,  their  very  physiognomies,  bear  the  same  impression  everywhere.  This  is  almost  ridiculously  prominent  in  the  guard,  where  they  put  the  men  with  light  hair  and  blue  eyes  into  one  company,  and  the  men  with  dark  hair  and  dark  eyes  into  another.  The  excessive  discipline  enforced  in  the  Rus Russian  sian Russian  army  has  no  parallel  since  the  time  of  the  Romans.  The  Russian  soldier  is  not  allowed  to  think  for  himself,  still  less  to  criticise.  This  passive,  obedience  has  given  rise  to  many  stories  of  the  spirit  of  an  order  being  sometimes  con confounded  founded confounded  with  the  letter.  One  day,  a  ship,  having  many  offi officers  cers officers  and  soldiers  on  board,  went  down  in  the  Neva.  The  order  was  passed  to  the  soldiers  to  save,  in  the  first  place,  the  officers  of  the  guard.  So,  of  each  person  they  succeeded  in  getting  hold,  they  anxiously  inquired  if  he  was  an  officer  of  the  guard  ?  The  water  filling  the  mouths  of  these  unfortu unfortunates,  nates, unfortunates,  they  could  not  answer;  so  they  were  allowed  to  drown.  Another  time,  it  being  very  dusty,  the  soldiers  were  ordered  to  water  the  field  for  exercise.  While  engaged  on  this  duty,  it  came  on  to  rain  heavily,  but  the  soldiers  con continued  tinued continued  their  labour  notwithstanding.  It  was  sufficient  that  it  was  ordered  !  At  the  time  of  the  destruction  of  the  winter  palace  by  fire,  a  priest  succeeded,  with  great  difficulty,  in  getting  into  the  chapel  to  rescue  the  sa sacramental  cramental sacramental  plate.  As  he  was  returning,  he  saw  a  soldier  in  the  corridor  enveloped  in  smoke.  '  Come  with  me,'  he  shouted  out,  'or  you  will  perish  in  the  flames.'  '  No,'  answered  the  soldier  ;  '  but  give  me  your  blessing.'  Another,  caught  in  an  inundation,  allowed  himself  to  be  drowned  rather  than  leave  his  post.  The  military  purposes  of  this  wonderful  subordination—probably  in  great  part  the  result  of  the  frequent  application  of  the  stick,  a  weapon  which  ;  plays  a  most  important  part  in  the  formation  of  the  Russian  soldier,  will  be  best  understood  from  another  anec anecdote.  dote. anecdote.  ,At  the  siege,  of  Warsaw,  a  young  grenadier,  address addressing  ing addressing  himself  to,  an  old  soldier,  and  pointing  towards  the  Polish  entrenchments,  said,  '  what  do  you  think,  comrade,  do  you  think  we  shall  take  those  entrenchments  I  scarcely  think  we  shall,'  answered  the  other  ;  they  are  too  strong.'  'But,'  added  the  young  soldier,  '  suppose  we  are  ordered  to  take  them  !  then  it  will  be  another  thing  ;  if  we  are  ordered  to  take  them,  we  will  take  them.'  ....  .  .  The  religious  feeling  is  entertained  in  the  Russian  regi regiments  ments regiments  by  a  number  of  papas  or  popes,  attached  to  each.  Every  soldier  has  his  amulets  and  images  of  saints.  The  empdror  gives  the  example  of  devotion.  On  Easter  Monday  he  issues  forth  from  the  palace  and  embraces  the  sentinel  posted  at  the  gate,  saying,  '  Christ  is  risen  again  !  '  to  which  the  soldier  answers,  '  Yes,  truly,  he  is  risen  again.'  It  is  _  _  •  d  said  that  one  day  the  soldier  on  duty  replied,  ‘  -- STYLE=superscript  Yes  so  they  say.'  He  happened  to  be  a  Tartar,  who  by  chances  of  con conscription,  scription, conscription,  had  got  into  the  guard.
