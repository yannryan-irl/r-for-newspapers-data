"SHIPPING  RETURNS  A  return  lately  printed,  of  the  shipping  and  tonnage  of  the  United  Kingdom,  furnishes  a  complete  account  of  the  progress  of  British  and  colonial  shipbuilding,  from  the  year  1814  to  the  present  time.  One  of  the  most  remarkable  facts  presented  by  this  statement,  is  the  constant  tendency  shown  to  increase  the  size  of  vessels.  In  1814,  the  average  capacity  of  all  the  ships  constructed  in  Great  Britain  during  that  year,  was  122  tons,  while  in  1852  it  was  235  tons.  Hence,  although  the  aggregate  of  new  tonnage  per  annum  has  nearly  doubled,  the  figures  have  been  86,075  tons  in  1815,  against  167,491  last  year;  the  number  of  vessels  built  each  year  has  remained  nearly  stationary,  the  total  having  been  706  in  1815,  and  712  in  1852.  In  colonial  built  ships  this  tendency  is  observable  to  a  still  greater  extent,  their  average  capacity  having  been  only  84  tons  in  1815,  while  in  1851  it  had  risen  to  207  tons.  At  the  same  time  the  advance  of  the  colonies  has  been  such  that,  notwithstanding  the  vast  increase  in  the  average  capacity  of  their  ships,  the  number  constructed  like likewise  wise likewise  shows  an  extraordinary  augmentation.  In  1815  they  built  131  vessels,  with  a  total  capacity  of  11,069  tons,  and  in  1851  the  number  was  680  vessels,  with  a  capacity  of  141,116  tons.  In  the  face  of  all  the  appre apprehensions  hensions apprehensions  on  account  of  the  repeal  of  the  navigation  laws,  a  total  tonnage  of  English  vessels  annually  con constructed  structed constructed  since  that  event,  has  shown  a  steady  increase,  and  last  year  it  was  larger  than  at  any  former  time,  with  the  exception  of  1840  and  1841,  when  an  unusual  addition  was  made  in  consequence  of  a  speculative  mania  that  had  prevailed  for  some  time  at  Sunderland.  In  the  colonies,  the  years  1840,  1841,  1842,  and  1848  were  the  most  active  ever  known  ;  and,  although  after  the  latter  year,  during  which  a  great  stimulus  had  been  imparted  by  the  demand  for  freight,  occasioned  by  the  famine  which  had  just  been  experienced  on  this  side,  a  reaction  took  place,  there  has  subsequently  been  a  steady  recovery,  until  in  1851  the  figures  again  rapidly  approached  the  total  from  which  they  had  receded.  For  1852,  the  colonial  returns  are  not  yet  complete,  but  they  will  probably  show  a  considerable  further  advance.  The  same  document  gives  an  account  of  the  number  of  vessels  belonging  to  the  several  ports  of  the  British  empire  in  each  year,  from  1814  to  1852  inclusive.  From  this  it  appears  that,  in  1814  the  total  of  vessels  was  24,418,  with  an  aggregate  capacity  of  2,615,965  tons,  employing  172,786  men  and  boys.  Last  year,  the  num number  ber number  wus  34,402  vessels,  with  a  tonnage  of  4,424,392  tons,  employing  243,512  men  and  boys.  During  the  interval  of  39  years,  therefore,  the  increase  of  vessels  was  equal  to  41  per  cent.,  of  tonnage  to  72  per  cent.,  and  of  men  to  40  per  cent.,  the  augmentation  of  capacity  and  the  improvements  in  construction  causing  a  comparative  economy  in  the  number  of  persons  employed.  A  return  is  likewise  given  of  the  number  of  foreign  ships  purchased  by  British  owners  since  the  repeal  of  the  navigation  laws,  viz.  :—in  1850,  1851,  and  1852.  From  this  it  appears,  that  the  totals  were-57,  with  a  capacity  of  10,499  tons,  in  1850  ;  26,  with  a  capacity  of  6,049  tons,  in  1851  ;  and  28,  with  a  capacity  of  6,724  tons,  in  1852.  It  is  evident,  therefore,  from  the  decline  which  occurred  after  the  first  year  of  experience,  that  British  builders  have  nothing  to  dread  from  the  superior  ability  or  cheapness  of  foreign  competitors.
