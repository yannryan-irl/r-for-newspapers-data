THIS  Company  is  formed  for  the  purpose  of  constructing  a  Floating  Dock  and  Harbour  at  Silloth  Bay,  in  the  SolwayFrith,  on  the  Coast  of  Cumberland,  and  connecting  the  same,  by  a  Railway  twelve  miles  and  three  quarters  in  length,  with  the  Port  Carlisle  Railway,  and  so  with  the  Junction  of  the  Caledonian,  Lancaster  and  Carlisle,  and  Newcastle  and  Carlisle  Railways,  at  Carlisle,  twenty-one  miles  distant.  A  safe  Port  on  the  North-W  est  coast  of  England,  where  Vessels  may  enter  and  load  and  discharge  at  all  times  of  the  tide,  has  long  been  requiredâ€”the  other  Ports  on  that  Coast,  as  Whitehaven,  Workington,  Maryport,  and  Port  Carlisle,  being  dry  harbours,  and  only  accessible  at  tide  time.  Silloth  Bay,  in  the  Solway  Frith,  and  distant  about  twenty-one  miles  from  Carlisle,  is  peculiarly  well  situated  for  the  construction  of  Floating  Docks,  and  a  Harbour  ac accessible  cessible accessible  to  Vessels  at  all  times  of  the  tide,  night  as  well  as  day,  being  a  safe  anchorage,  with  deep  water  close  to  the  shore,  in  which  large  vessels  may  ride  the  whole  of  the  twenty-four  hours  --the  depth  of  water  at  low  water  of  the  highest  spring  tides  being  from  three-and-a-half  to  five fiveand-a-half  and-a-half fiveand-a-half  fathoms."
