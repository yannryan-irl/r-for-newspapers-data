On  reaching  Besika  Bay,  on  the  6th,  she  found  the  combined  fleets  preparing  to  enter  the  Dardanelles  and  proceed  to  Constantinople.  The  account  of  Omer  Pacha  having  received  orders  to  summon  Prince  GortSchakoff  to  evacuate  the  prin principalities  cipalities principalities  within  15  days  is  confirmed  by  this  ar  rival.  The  advices  state  that  M.  de  Crevecour,  the  Prefect  of  the  Department  of  the  Bouches  du  Rhone,  has  set  off  suddenly  for  Constantinople,  but  the  object  of  his  mission  had  not  transpired.  Pressing  orders,  had,  it  is  said,.been  sent  to  Toulon  to  fit  out  immediately  several  powerful  steam  frigates,  intended  for  the  conveyance  of  troops.  Notwithstanding  all  these  warlike  appearances,  the  majority  of  the  monied  world  were  of  opinion  that  peace  would  yet  be  maintained.

Indeed,  the  expression  used  by  the  Emperor  is,  if  I  am  rightly  informed,  of  the  strongest  kind,  however  incompatible  with  the  pontifical  character  of  his  Majesty  ;  it  not  merely'  says  '  war,'  but  war  of  exterminationâ€” extermination'  ' extermination'  guerre  d'extermination.'&#34;  A  Vienna  correspondent  of  our  contemporary  - STYLE=superscript  Two  diplomatic  notes  of  considerable  importance  have  bedn  received  here  within  the  last  few  days.
