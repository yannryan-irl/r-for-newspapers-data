It  was  referred  to  the  smoke  sub-committee.  Mr.  Beckwith  said  he  did  not  know  what  to  do  with  it,  and  he  would,  therefore,  suggest  that  it  be  allowed  to  lie  on  the  table.  (No,  no.)  Mr.  Ilaydock  brought  under  the  notice  of  the  committee  a  nuisance  arising  from  a  slaughter-house  in  Plumb-street.  It  appeared,  however,  that  the  place  had  been  licensed  by  the  Council,  and  that  the  medical  officers  approved  of  the  site  for  the  purpose;  This  concluded  the  business.

The  length  of  the  race  was  eight  miles  ;  the  time  occupied  by  the  mare  183  minutes,  over  a  rough;  gravelly,  and  sandy  road.  The  same  race  has  'been  offered  for  the  'last'  two  years  against  all  England,  for  !10,000  sovereigns,  with  the  same  horse,  and  not  accepted.  The,  Egyptian  princes  are  now  convinced  that  their  Arabs  can  be  beaten  by  English  horses..

During  the  same  period  the  Earldom  of  Seuthesk,  a  Scottish  title  attainted  in  the  rebellion  of  the  last  century,  has  been  restored  in  the  person  of  Sir  James  Carnegie,  Bart.  ;  Mr.  Edmund  Burke  Roche,  late  M.P.  for  County  Cork,  has  been  raised  to  the  Irish  peerage  as  Lord  Fermoy,  and  Mr.  Baron  Parke  has  been  created  an  English  peer  by  the  title  of  Lord  Ampthill.  MANUMISSION  or  A  SLAVE.—At  the  Mansion  House,  London,  on  Wednesday  last,  the  novel  and  interesting  cir circumstance  cumstance circumstance  of  emancipating  a  slave  took  place  before  the  Lord  Mayor.  The  Secretary  of  the  British  and  Foreign  Anti-Slavery  Society  said  the  slave  in  ,  question,  Philip  Bailey,  was  a  native  of  Maryland,  United  States,  and  had  been  a  doinestic  slave.  During  the  last  five  years  he  had  been  engaged  as  steward  on  board  one  of  the  American  ships  sailing  from  Liverpool,  in  'which  '  capacity  he  shad  saved  200  dollars  with  which  to  purchase  his  freedom,  and  which  had  been  negotiated  by  the  society's  agents.  The  object  of  the  applicant  in  handing  the  document  of  manumission  to  Bailey  in  public  was,  that  in  the  event  of  his  losing  the  document  he  mighi,  -be  able  to  refer  to  the  newspapers  of  the  country  as  proof  of  his  having  obtained  his  freedom.  The  Lord  Mayor  said  it  afforded  him  much  pleasure  at  witnessing  such  interesting  ceremony,  and  he  had  no  doubt  the  press  would  give  publicity  to  such  a  novel  and  humane  circumstance.  Bailey,  an  intelligent  young  Dian,  with  an  appearance  very  prepossessing,  and  far  superior  to  his  class,  received  the  document  wiih  feelings  of  satisfaCtiOn  and  pride  )  and  having  thanked  his  lordship  )  retired,  TATTERSALL'S.-  ;]LLIGENCI  ESTERDAT  EVENING.
