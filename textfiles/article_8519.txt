In  1854  .•.  3,264  „  Together  In  1855  the  rece  5,337  „  ave  exceeded  the  liveries  by  3,264  „  lowing  a  decrease  of  2,093  puns,  in  the  stock  upon  the  trade  of  the  three  years.  The  excess  of  receipts  over  deliveries,  in  1855,  took  place  at  the  end  of,  the  year.  About  the  middle  of  September,  the  stock  was  so  low  that  some  descriptions  of  rum  were  not  to  be  had  in  this  market;  and,  being  in  demand,  buyers  resorted  to  London  for  their  supply.  This  led  to  about  1400  puncheons  being  brought  down,  which  arrived  over  the  months  of  Novem November  ber November  and  December.  Add  to  this  about  MO  puncheons  of  British  Plantation  and  Foreign,  included  in  the  receipts  but  not  landed,  and  which  chiefly  arrived  after  the  20th  December.  The  trade  of  the  past  year  has  disclosed  that,  whatever  may  be  the  amount  of  stock  remaining  on  hand,  it  is  reduced  to  the  minimum  ;  and  that  business,  owing  to  the  rather  higher  prices  which  have  ruled  is,  necessarily,  from  the  small  stock,  and  higher  prices,  a  to  business.  It  is  necessary  to  remark,  that  our  object  has  been  to  exhibit  the  trade  in  rum  alone.  It  is  well  known  that  rums  are  frequently  re  d  uce  d  w  i  t  h  water,  and  mixed  with  both  British  and  Forei  g  n  s  pi  r  it  s  f  o  r  exportation  .
