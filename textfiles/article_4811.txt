"PRESTON  MANUFACTURERS  IN  BLACKBU.RN.  We  have  already  noticed  in  this  journal  the  violence  offered  to  certain  gentlemen  attending  the  Blackburn  market,  recently  by  parties  either  connected  or  sympathising  with  the  operatives  now  on  strike  in  the  mid  districts  of  Lancashire.  The  spinners  and  masters  of  Preston  believing  they  were  the  especial  objects  of  di  s  lik  e  on  th  at  occasion,  have  addressed  Lord  Palmerston  upon  the  subject  in  the  subjoined  letter.  We  may  here  state  that  the  Mayor  of  Blackburn  was  of  opinion  that  a  large  part  of  the  people  assembled  upon  that  occasion  had  followed  the  masters  over  from  Preston.  His  worship  estimated  the  numbers  present  on  the  occasion  at  4,000,  and  is  of  opinion,  in  which  his  brother  justices  coin coincide,  cide, coincide,  that  the  ordinary  civil  force  of  the  borough  is  unable  to  cope  with  the  sudden  interruptions  to  the  peace  to  which  Blackburn,  under  present  circumstances,  is  subject,  and  that  a  company  of  soldiers  should  be  placed  there.  The  town  police  are  to  be  increased  to  thirty.  It  is  said  that  the  operatives  of  Burnley  will  take  the  masters'  offer  to  resume  work  at  the  old  wages,  and  forego  connexion  with  the  strikes  in  other  places.  The  mills  of  Bacup,  will  be  opened  on  Thursday  next,  on  the  Burnley  terms.  The  Harwood  millowners  are,  it  is  rumoured,  about  to  work  short  time  and  take  off  the  ten  per  cent,  co-operating  with  those  at  Accrington.  At  Accrington,  says  a  London  journal,  where  to  the  present  time  only  a  couple  of  mills  have  been  closed,  the  rest  having  given  the  ten  per  cent,  advance,  notice  was  served  upon  the  weavers  generally  ten  or  twelve  days  ago  that  it  would  only  be  given  a  fort fortnight  night fortnight  long  , STYLE=superscript  r,  and  it  is  expected  that  4,000  looms  will  there  be  thrown  idle,  adding  largely  in  a  few  days  to  the  unem unemployed  ployed unemployed  if  the  operatives  should  resolve  to  strike,  as  it  is  ex expected  pected expected  they  will  do.  A  meeting  of  Blackburn  masters  also  had  been  summoned  for  yesterday,  to  consider  the  pro propriety  priety propriety  of  doing  the  same  thing,  and  this  had  become  public.  The  memorial  or  letter  addressed  to  the  home  secretary  is  as  follows  :  Lord  ,  —  We  beg  t  o  d  raw  your  lordship  '  s  attention  to  the  riots  and  disturbances  which  took  place  at  Blackburn  on  Wednesday  last.  Blackburn  is  the  seat  of  a  large  cot cotton  ton cotton  manufacture,  and  the  master  cotton  spinners,  agents,  manufacturers,  and  others  from  Preston  and  other  places  in  the  district,  are  in  the  habit  of  meeting  there  on  Wednes Wednesdays  days Wednesdays  for  the  purpose  of  transacting  busineSs.  Most  of  these  gentlemen  stay  at  the  Bull  Hotel  in  Black  •  burn,  and  at  the  front  of  that  hotel  they  assemble  to  transact  their  business.  On  Wednesday  last  the  Preston  cotton  spinners  were  informed  on  their  arrival  in  Blackburn,  that  they  were  to  be  attacked  by  a  mob  and  turned  out  of  the  town.  This  threat  appears  to  have  been  partially  carried  out,  and  from  what  has  since  transpired,  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  it  was  a  preconcerted  step,  and  that  it  was  known  in  the  town  that  something  of  the  kind  would  be  attempted.  will  not  here  trouble  yew  lordship  with  the  parti particulars  culars particulars  of  what  took  place,  but  send  for  your  lordship's  perusal  the  three  Preston  papers  containing  accounts  of  the  disturbance.  But  we  may  be  permitted  to  call  your  lord lordship's  ship's lordship's  attention  to  the  fact,  that  after  a  mob  of  people  had  been  assembled  for  a  lone  , STYLE=superscript  time  in  one  of  th  e  mos  t  pu  bli  c  streets  in  the  town,  with  the  avowed  object  of  ill-treating  the  Preston  masters,  the  safety  of  the  persons  and  pro property  perty property  in  the  principal  hotel  in  the  town  could  only  be  secured  by  allowing  six  delegates  from  the  mob  to  search  every  room  in  the  house  for  those  whom  they  wished  to  attack.  At  the  present  time  most  of  the  operative  cotton  spinners  and  weavers  in  Preston  are  out  of  employment  in  consequence  of  the  dispute  between  themselves  and  their  employers,  and  we  are  happy  to  state  that  hitherto  no  se serious  rious serious  breach  of  the  peace  has  occurred.  For  this  we  are  mainly  indebted  to  the  generally  well  disposed  and  peaceable  character  of  the  inhabitants,  but  also  to  the  mayor  and  other  borough  magistrates,  for  the  firmness  which  they  displayed,  and  for  the  decided  measures  which  they  adopted  here  at  the  commencement  of  the  strike.  On  the  other  hand,  whilst  the  operatives  engaged  in  the  cotton  trade  in  Blackburn  have  been,  and  are,  in  full  em employment,  ployment, employment,  that  town  has  been  for  some  time  past  the  scene  of  great  excitement  and  disorder.  Acts  of  violence  and  dis disturbances  turbances disturbances  have  frequently  been  repeated,  and  on  more  than  ono  occasion  persons  and  property  have  seriotudy  suffered  at  the  hands  of  lawless  mobs.  From  what  occurred  on  Wednesday  last,  it  is  quite  ap apparent  parent apparent  that  the  Preston  cotton  masters  have  rendered  them themselves  selves themselves  obnoxious  to  the  operatives  of  Blackburn,  and  in  the  present  state  of  feeling  in  that  town  cannot,  without  danger  of  annoyance  and  injury,  continue  their  necessary  visits  to  that  place,  unless  some  steps  are  taken  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  such  acts  of  ungoverned  violence  as  those  we  have  alluded  to.  That  such  steps  are  rendered  imperatively  necessary  we  ;hink  there  can  be  no  doubt.  We  have  the  honour  to  be  your  lordship's  most  obedien  -{Here  followed  the  signatures.]  SOUTH  WESTERN  RAILWAY.  In  our  law  report  the  reader  will  find  reported  an  appli application  cation application  on  the  part  of  the  chairman  and  directors  of  this  company,  against  the  Times  newspaper  for  a  libel  contained,  as  is  alleged,  in  an  article  printed  in  that  journal  on  Tuesday  last.  The  Railway  Times  has  the  following  extraordinary  statement  respecting  the  same  body  :  The  directors  have  voted  £5OO  to  Captain  Moorsom,  the  gentleman  who  did  not  expect  anything,  for  his  services  in  the  cause  of  the  Dorchester  Extension  ;  they  have  ordered  the  plans  to  be  finished,  as,  according  to  the  view  of  Mr.  Bircham,  they  may  be  useful  at  another  time  ;  they  have  refused  to  print  the  poll  as  suggested  by  Mr.  Sergt.  Gaselee,  and  laughed  outright  at  a  proposition  of  Captain  Johnston  to  print  the  votes  in  May  iu  juxtaposition  with  those  in  November.  But  as  to  whether  or  not  the  Dorchester  Exten Extension  sion Extension  is  abandoned  or  not,  even  for  this  year,  no  official  declaration  exists  '  •  we  only  know  that  the  expenses  in  general,  incurred  by  the  board  in  their  ext  ens  i  on  crusa  d  e  during  the  last  few  months,  amounting  to  £15,000,  are  in  course  of  quiet  and  orderly  liquidation  out  of  the  funds  of  the  company.  Mr.  Scott  has  been  talking  at  of  resigning,  and  fortunately,  it  is  there  suggested  that  this  is  the  only  course  a  can  adopt  ;  but  the  board  is  not  yet  favoured  with  his  resignation.  Mr.  Hutchins,  an  ,  old  candidate  for  a  seat  in  the  direction,  is  spoken  of  to  supply  the  probable  vacancy,  that  gentleman  having  a  nice  little  extension  to  Lymington  to  propose.  On  the  other  hand,  the  shareholders'  committee  are  making  converts  rapidly.  Mr.  Chaplin  considers  the  ques question  tion question  finally  settled.  Mr.  Kay  will  be  no  party  to  its  revival.  These  two  names  alone  take  away  nearly  £200,000  of  the  £600,000  so  vauntingly  produced  as  the  majority  of  capital  in  favour  of  the  ext,;a6ion.  When  we  state  that  the  remain remainder  der remainder  is  more  than  made  up  by  the  votes  of  the  bankers,  the  solicitors,  the  engineers,  and  the  contractors,  each  personally  and  pecuniarily  interested  in  the  extravagance,  we  need  not  further  dwell  on  the  topic.  All  the  deadweight  is  already  thrown  in  against  the  shareholders,  and  every  vote  that  can  be  brought  forward  in  opposition  to  it,  must  lessen  its  severity  and  faroo.  If  is  fharofnril  occontial,  vitally  so,  that  the  shareholders  at  large,  if  they  desire  the  current  of  adhesion  now  fixedly  setting  in  to  continue,  should  conduct  their  future  operations  with  more  than  ordinary  decorum.  That  alone  is  necessary  to  place  Mr.  Snell's  committee  in  a  position  to  command  a  majority  of  the  entire  capital  of  the  company  at  the  half-yearly  meeting.  The  Death  of  Lady  Sandford  is  announced  in  the  journals.  THE  DUKE  AND  THE  SAILORS'  HOME.—The  Duke  of  Northumberland,  who  is  deservedly  held  in  the  highest  esteem  by  the  seafaring  population  in  the  north-east  ports,  is  about  to  make  a  princely  donation  to  the  seamen  visiting  the  Tyne.

The  Duke  of  Northumberland,  however,  is  about  to  erect,  and  present  to  the  port,  a  handsome  Sailors'  Home,  at  North  Shields,  the  cost  of  which  will  be  4,0001.  The  land,  which  has  also  been  contributed  by  his  grace,  is  worth  1,0001.  more.  The  building  will  have  accommodation  for  above  100  seamen,  and  will  be  furnished  with  a  library,  savings  bank,  baths  and  wash-houses,  nautical  school,  &amp;c.  All  'that  the  duke  requested  of  the  shipowners  of  the  port,  before  commencing  with  the  building,  was,  that  they  should  raise  2,0001.  for  i  t  s  en  d  owmen  t  .  1,6001.  have  been  sub subscribed,  scribed, subscribed,  and  the  other  4001.  have  just  been  guaranteed  by  several  gentlemen  belonging  to  Shields.

Cambard,  a  Frenchwoman,  but  bearing  the  Italianised  name  of  Cambardi,  figured  in  it.  Alboni  was  received  with  enthu enthusiasm  siasm enthusiasm  ;  and  she  well  deserved  it,  as,  though  not  one  whit  less  stout  than  she  used  to  be—au  contraire—she  sang  with  all  her  wonted  sweetness.  Tamburini,  too,  was  heartily  welcomed;  but  she  is  not  the  Tamburini  of  former  days.  Halevy  is  writing  a  new  two-act  opera  for  the  Grand  Opera  at  Paris.
