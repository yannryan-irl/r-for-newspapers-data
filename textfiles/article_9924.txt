SALTPETRE  :  100  b  are  r2port3tl  at  37  er  cwt  for  11  parter,  INDIAN  RUBBER  action,  from  30  to  40  t  to  is  10d  p  qualit  pported  the  rates  rea  Wool.:  Since  the  issue  of  our  annual  circular,  the  wool  market  has  exhibited  great  firmness,  and  all  connected  with  the  trade  admit  that  a  drawback  is  impossible  in  value,  whether  war  continues  or  peace  ensues  ;  in  the  event  of  the  pending  negociations  being  amicable,  the  raw  material  would  rapidly  advance  in  price.  The  stocks  of  all  descriptions  have  been  almost  cleared,  so  that  purchasers  find  great  difficulty  in  supplying  themselves;  this  position  of  affairs  will  doubtless  be  rendered  still  more  awkward,  from  the  announcement  b  7  the  French  Government,  of  a  considerable  reduction  of  the  import  duty  on  all  wools  from  this  country,  thus  enabling  the  continental  consumers  to  compete  more  successfully  with  buyers  here,  and  causing  a  large  increase  in  the  export  demand,  which  the  last  year  has  proved  to  be  greatly  in  excess  of  all  previous  ones.  To  our  own  manufactures,  this  movement  will  be  of  serious  import  '  -  for  a  time  it  may  be  regarded  in  a  t  r  ifli  ng  d  egree,  b  ut  no  question  can  be  entertained  that  eventually,  it  will  '  revolutionize  the  markets,  and  -work  - STYLE=superscript  extensive  ichanges  in'the  value  to  growers,  and  importers.  In  the  consuming  districts,  large  orders  are  in  course  of  execution,  both  for  army  requirements,  American  demand,  and  home  supply  ;  a  general  tone  of  cheerfulness  emanates  from  every  quarter,  notwithstanding  the  high  rate  of  discounts,  which  attests  the  soundness  ai..d  stability  of  this  important  branch  of  manufacture.  Fleeces  grown  in  this  country  have  already  experienced  the  influence  of  the  reduction  of  the  duty  in  France,  and  a  rise  of  fully  id  per  lb.  is  observable  on  comb combing  ing combing  sorts  ;  this  advance  will,  ere  long,  be  increased,  the  quantity  in  staplers'  hands  being  reduc  e  d,  an  d  what  is  in  the  hands  of  growers  is  chiefly  held  for  rates  that  are  quite  unapproachable  at  present.  The  principal  feature  of  last  month  was  the  series  of  auc`ion  sales,  which  were  held  from  the  15th  to  the  19th,  the  quantity  offered  was  rather  under  14,000  bales,  upwards  of  9,000  bales  being  East  India  Owing  to  the  large  supply  of  the  latter  kind  for  these  sales,  considerable  interest  was  evinced,  and  the  attendance  was  above  an  average,  with  a  spirited  competition.  White  of  the  first  class  realized  extreme  rates,  medium  qualities  went  a  shade  easier,  :yellow  of  first  quality  commanded  hih  i  value,  while  th  e  m  iddl  e  and  inferior  declined  d  to  d  per  lb  ;  good  greys  and,  fawns  sold  dearer  ;  the  lower  qualities  were  sustained.  The  Egyptian  was  not  sufficiently  lengthy  in'  staple  to  bring  combining  value  ;  what  was  moved,  sold  dear.  Buenos  Ayres  was  not  very  choice,  otherwise  there  were  buyers.  All  t  e  other  classes  were  but  a  poor  assortment,  being  mostly  old  stocks,  were  withdrawn.  Fine  shafty  Turkey,  and  half  fine  Bosnia,  and  Semis,  are  much  asked  for,  the  coarser  kinds  do  not  move  freely,  but  great  quantity  here.  Oporto  fleece  in  good  repute,  Lambs  are  held  firmly  fur  10d  per  lb.  •  •  Buenos  Ayres  is  in  request  for  export  and  home  consumption..

W  English  and  Irish  :  Both  these  descriptions  have  been  very  saleable,  at  fully  ld  per  lb.  higher  ;  but  this  increase  in  value  is  not  commensurate  with  the  prices  demanded  by  the  growers;  middle  wethers  have  experienced  an  active  de demand  mand demand  at  14d  per  lb.,  with  symptoms  of  a  further  rise,  which  is  mainly  attributable  to  the  reduction  of  duty  on  the  con continent,  tinent, continent,  and  the  •  limited  supply  in  the  market:  Oil:  The  stock  being  large,  upwards  of  3,400  tuns,  holders  have  given  way,  which  induced  buyers  to  operate  to  some  extent  ;  the  market  closes  quietly,,  consumers  looking  for  a  further  decline,  quotations  barely  supported.
