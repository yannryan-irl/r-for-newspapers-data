"A  REVIEW  OP  BRITISH  FINANCES  IN  1855  The  finances  of  a  country  even  during'  a  time  of  peace  must  always  form  one  of  the  highest  considerations  of  the  executive  Government:  and  when  war  enters  into  the  elements  of  national  expenditure,  the  highest  efforts  of  financial  skill  are  as  essen essential  tial essential  to  the  6tiecess  and  stability  .  of  Government,  as  the  genius  and  courage  of  the  General  entrusted  to  direct  the  movements  of  the  forces  at  his  command.  The  warrior  and  the  financier  are  in  such  cases  beset  with  difficulties  on  every  side  that  are  continually  changing  their  character.  At  one  time  they  must  be  prepared  to  meet  them  with  boldness  and  courage,  without  fearing  the  dreadful  cost  at  which  success  can  only  be  purchased  :  while  at  another,  discretion  and  sound  judgment  are  far  more  valuable  than  either.  The  history  of  the  last  war  immortalised  the  name  and  career  of  William  Pitt  :  and  though  modern  statesmen  have  attempted  to  show  that  his  financial  system  for  carrying  on  a  costly  and  protracted  war  was  based  upon  false  principles,  they  :have  failed  to  show  how  victory  would  have  been  obtained  without  it.  Nothing  is  easier  for  a  mere  theo theorist  rist theorist  than  to  question  the  policy  of  a  public  man  when  time  has  swept  away  the  difficulties  that  encompassed  his  position,  and  hence  the  errors  that  were  promulgated  at  the  commencement  of  the  present  war  as  to  the  principle  upon  which  th  e  mea  n  s  should  be  raised  for  conducting  it  properly.  It  was  here  that  Mr.  Gladstone  committed  a  grave  mistake  when  lie  permitted  himself  to  be  influenced  by  the  delusive  charm  of  paying  for  the  war  as  he  went  on,  by  raising  the  amount  by  taxation  within  the  year.  But  although  this  plan  was  vin vindicated,  dicated, vindicated,  and  set  forth,  with  remarkable  plausibility,  in  the  columns  of  a  semi-official  organ  of  the  government  until  the  delusion  was  dispelled  by  dire  necessity,  we  never  for  a  single  moment  allowed  it  to  be  countenanced  in  our  columns,  and  what  we  wrote  in  January,  1855,  we  have  no  need  to  retract  in  January,  1856.  •  On  the  13th  of  January  last  year  we  made  the  following  remarks  on  the  revenue  returns  :--  a  time  when  we  are  carrying  on  a  costly  war,  the  termi termination  nation termination  of  which  cannot  be  calculated  ;  when  we  are  told  that  we  must  pay  as  we  go  these  returns  demand•  the  most  serious  attention  of  the  nation.  On  the  total  income  of  the  country,  the  inerease  only  amounts  to  £2,291,356  for  the  past  year.  It  is  not  for  us  to  decide  whether  we  arc  to  carry  on  war  upon  credit  or  for  cash  we  may  trace  in  the  finance  department  the  main  secret  of  the  false  economy  which  has  been  practised,  and  the  intimate  cause  of  our  numerous  failures  in  the  prosecution  of  it.  We  have  repeatedly  stated,  that  suc successful  cessful successful  war  and  sound  commerce  and  finance  are  insep inseparable.  arable. inseparable.  We  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  political  bearing  of  the  subject  in  question  ;  but  we  believe  that  the  financial  re resources  sources resources  of  this  great  empire  have  been  managed  with  as  much  indiscretion  and  want  of  judgment  as  the  military  and  naval  departments  of  the  State.  We  have  bound  ourselves  with  preconceived  theories  in  war,  commerce,  and  finance,  instead  of  launching  out  boldly  to  meet  the  altered  circumstances  in  which  we  are  placed,  and  the  changes  of  the  times  in  which  we  live.  In  vain  do  our  heroes  go  forth  to  do  battle  for  their  country,  if  we  confine  our  plans  and  our  actions  to  a  paltry  economy.  It  is  the  economy  of  life,  and  not  of  money  that  England  Within  a  few  months  after  writing  this  the  Government  was  compelled  to  give  up  Mr.  Gladstone's  long  cherished  theory  of  paying  for  the  war  by  an  annual  amount  of  taxation,  by  con contracting  tracting contracting  for  a  loan.  But  it  is  impossible  to  calculate  the  amount  of  difficulties  which  were  entailed  upon  it  by  his  rigid  adhe.  rence  to  a  principle  which  bore  upon  the  face  of  it  an  impossi impossibility  bility impossibility  in  practice.  We  shall  now  give  a  brief  outline  of  the  financial  state  of  the  country  during  the  year  that  has  just  terminated,  in  which  we  shall  set  forth  the  principal  facts  which  have  transpired  in  the  fiscal  and  financial  arrangements  of  the  Government.  The  Finance  Minister  of  this  country  is  so  far  a  free  agent  that  he  is  subject  to  no  defined  principles  of  action,  but  has,  in  a  great  degree,  the  right  of  making  his  selection  as  to  the  taxes  he  wishes  to  impose  or  remit,  subject,  of  course,  to  the  considera consideration  tion consideration  of  his  colleagues  in  the  Cabinet  ;  so  that  a  change  in  this  department  of  the  Administration  may  lead  to  opinions  of  the  most  opposite  character  ;  this  has  been  clearly  seen  in  the  financial  statements  of  Mr.  Disraeli  and  Mr.  Gladstone.  What  views  the  present  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  entertains  upon  the  principles  of  taxation  have  yet  to  he  known,  so  far  as  the  past  year  is  concerned  we  cannot  consider  him  in  any  way  responsible  for  the  means  adopted  to  meet  the  heavy  expenditure  entailed  upon  the  Treasury  by  the  war  :  for  being  installed  into  office  on  a  sudden  emergency,  there  was  no  course  left  open  to  him  but  to  follow  in  the  steps  of  his  pre predecessor,  decessor, predecessor,  and  make  the  best  of  the  means  placed  at  his  command.  The  finances  of  18:55  are  therefore  the  result  of  Mr.  Gladstone's  legislation  rather  than  that  of  Sir  George  Cornewall  Lewis.  The  exact  amount  of  the  national  revenue  at  the  beginnin7  of  1853  stood  at  £56,822,510  against  £54,531,154,  being  an  increase  of  £2,291,356.  This  was  the  result  of  Mr.  Gladstone's  means  for  providing  for  the  war,  at  the  close  of  the  first  year  after  its  commencement,  from  the  ordinary  sources  of  revenue.  The  results  for  each  quarter  compared  with  those  of  the  cones-  Pending  quarters  i❑  1853  being  as  follows  :-  Ist  quarter  ..  £  363,040  increase.  2nd  do  3rd  do  369,587  decrease.  857,336  increase.  1,440,007  Increase.  The  total  expenditure  during  the  same  period  compared  with  1854,  was  as  follows  :  Total  Expenditure  in  1854.  Total  Expenditure  in  1855.  Ist  quarter  £10,076,287  £20,834,896  3rd  ditto  4th  ditto  7,775,779  20,906,995  18,653,940  27,886,908  27,253,258  24,268,520  Increase  57,413,001  £42,830,581  100,243,532  The  above  statement  shows  the  extent  to  which  the  wir  had  increased  the  expenditure  of  the  country  at  the  end  of  twenty twentyone  one twentyone  months  after  the  declaration  of  hostilities,  The  effect  of  this  upon  the  finances  of  the  treasury,  after  taking  into  consi consideration  deration consideration  the  funds  raised  upon  exchequer-bonds,  exchequer  -  bills,  and  the  loan  of  £16,000,000,  has  been  to  create  the  following  deficits  upon  each  quarter  of  1855  :  let  quarter  Deficits  in  1855.  ..  £3,495,615  ~.  3,306,463  853,442  ..  3,879,750  2nd  do  3rd  do  4th  do  The  year  1855  opened  upon  the  Finance  Minister  with  the  prospect  of  an  annual  expenditure  amounting  to  90  or  100  millions  sterling,  wnich  was  nearly  double  the  amount  of  the  ordinary  revenue  in  time  of  peace  ;  this  was  sufficient  to  dispel  all  the  illusions  which  Mr.  Gladstone  and  the  school  of  econo economists  mists economists  to  which  he  belonged,  indulged  as  to  the  possibility  of  paying  for  the  war  simply  by  an  increase  of  taxation.  He  had,  however,  the  honour  of  propounding  an  increase  in  this  direc direction,  tion, direction,  which,  it  was  intended,  should  produce  £6,880,000  per  annum  from  the  following  articles  in  May,  1854  :  Income  tax  Spirit  duties  Sugar  duties,  Malt  duty..  £3,280,000  450,000  700,000  2,450,000  Total  .  Mr.  Gladstone's  estimate  of  the  duty  to  be  yielded  by  the  increased  malt  tax  was  made  upon  a  consumption  of  40,000,000  bushels,  the  quantity  consumed  in  1853  having  been  41,992,178  bushels;  but  in  1854  the  consumption  diminished  to  36,812,727  bushels,  which  was  sufficient  alone  to  reduce  Mr.  Gladstone's  estimate  by  £1.035,000  ;  a  faLtt  which  proved  the  uncertainty  of  increasing  the  revenue  by  indirect  taxes.  The  present  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  commenced  his  official  career  under  circumstances  of  no  ordinary  difficulty.  Ho  bad  to  appear  before  the  country  with  a  balance  sheet  showing  a  deficit  of  3  millions  (13,495,615).  The  ordinary  revenue  for  the  year  ended  March  31,  1853,  was  £58,764,576  against  £52,076,526  in  1854,  being  an  increase  of  £6,688,050.  This  fact  carried  sufficient  weight  with  it  to  show  the  impossibility  of  meeting  the  expenses  of  the  war,  without  appealing  to  the  money  market  for  a  loan.  On  the  12th  of  April,  1855,  a  letter  from  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  was  addressed  to  the  Governor  and  Deputy_  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  England,  to  intimate  that  Govern Governuncut  uncut Governuncut  would  be  ready  to  see  parties  desirous  of  contracting  fur  a  loan  on  the  16th  of  April,  when  the  particulars  were  made  known  for  the  sum  of  £16,000,000  ;  the  contractors  for  every  £lOO  snbscribed  were  to  receive  £lOO  Three  per  Cent  Canso  lidated  Annuities,  and  a  terminable  annuity  for  30  years,  in  which  the  h  tidings  were  to  be  made.  The  interest  on  the  consolidated  annuities  to  commence  on  the  sth  of  January,  1855,  and  that  on  the  terminable  annuity  from  the  sth  of  April,  1855.  The  payments  to  be  made  in  nine  instalments,  including  the  deposit,  in  accordance  with  the  terms  set  forth  in  the  Bankers'  Circular  of  the  21st  of  April  last.  The  budget  of  Sir  George  Cornewall  Lewis,  in  April,  1855  comprised  a  demand  for  £86,339,000,  towards  which  provision  }rid  only  been  made  for  £63,339,000,  leaving  a  deficiency  of  £23,000,000  to  be  supplied  from  other  sources.  This  sum  was  to  be  met  by  A  Loan  0f..,  Extra  Taxes  Exchequer  Bills  £16,000,000  4,000,000  3,000,000  £23,000,000  The  articles  on  which  the  extra  taxes  were  to  be  levied  were  Sugar,  Coffee,  Tea,  Spirits,  Bankers'  Cheques,  and  an  addition  of  1  per  cent,  to  the  previous  rate  of  income  tax.  The  state  of  the  revenue  and  expenditure  to  the  31st  of  March,  1855,  which  terminated  the  financial  period  of  Mr.  Gladstone,  was  as  follows  :  Revenue  from  Taxes  Exchequer  -bonds  Excbequer-bills  ...  .  £59,496,154  5,375,513  1,750,000  Total  Revenue  ,  Actual  Expenditure  •  6 STYLE=superscript  6,621,667  •  65,692,962  Surplus  The  above  balance  is  exclusive  of  £5,020,000  in  taxes  due  to  March  31st  and  not  collected  .  Mr.  Gladstone  estimated  the  expenditure  of  the  year  to  March  31st,  1855,  at  51,198,000;  but  the  actual  sum  was  65,692,962,  being  an  increase  of  X  14,494,962.
