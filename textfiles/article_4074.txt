"URQUHART'S  name  has  measures  for  the  in  the  OTTOMAN  Empire.  His  counsel  ought  there-  fore  to  be  r  eived  with  the  utmost  attention  As  for  Sir  CHARLES  NAPIER'S  political  predilection  we  need  only  say,  they  are  British  !  He  is  in  fact  more  a  man,  of  the  Empire,  than  citizen.  He  knows  the  value  of  a  true  ally  and  he  knows  how  to  handle  a  designing  enem  Then  round  him  for  although  he  be  not  a  king,  he  is  a  British  sailor,  and  it  is  such  that  England  must  oppose  .to  the  audacious  Mus-  covite,  and  that  blundering  diplomacy  that  makes  England  appear  the  tool  of  Russian  mendacity.  But  before  we  send  him  to  sound  the  horn  of  after  the  flying  Russians  let  us  see  him  in  Liverpool.  .He  has  been  hailed  from  the  Mersey  before  now,  or  we  are  much  mistaken,  and  let  the  Mersey  again  hail  Sit  C  HARLE  A  banquet  at  the  Town  Hall  of  Liverpool,  to  this  sea-going  hero,  wilt  be  a  relief  to  the  ordinary,  every-day  scenes,  we  are  called  on  to  record  from  that  hot-bed  of  -.  Here  we  pause  for  certain  reasons.  Still  we  have  hope  for  better  things,  and  let  us  not  be  disappointed  in  the  treat  of  seeing  a  venerable  old  sailor  laying  down  in  the  second  sea-  port  of  the  the  true  course  our  country  ought  to  pursue  at  a  crisis  when  secret  diplomacy  might  have  thrown  millions  of  our  maritime  pro  perty  into  the  hands  of  the  Imperial  enemy.  If  anything  be  wrong.  in  Downing-street,  let  nothing  be  '  wrong  in  the  North.  Let  Liverpool  hear  the  truth,  and  invite  a  NAPIER,  and  a  sailor,  to  tell  it.  This  is  our  earnest  advice.  A  full  report  of  the  anti-Russian  meeting  at  Manchester  yesterday,  will  be  found  in  another  part  of  the  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES  them  !  Yes,  my  good  sir"
