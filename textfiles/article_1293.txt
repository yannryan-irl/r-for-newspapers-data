"LIVERPOOL  CORN  MARKET,  New  York  letters  to  the  27th  ult,  report  the  market  as  very  moderately  supplied,  which,  added  to  to  the  improved  accounts  from  England,  caused  an  advance  on  Wheat  of  Is  to  Is  6d  per  qr.,  and  in  Flour  of  is  3d  per  barrel,  with  an  increased  export  demand;  the  week's  shipment  consisted  of  500  qrs.  Wheat  4,333  brls.  Flour  to  London.  22,300  do.  ....  5,805  do.  to  Liverpool.  4,200  do.  ..  ..  1,357  do.  to  Bristol  Channel.  12,000  do.  —.30,788  do.  to  France.  Indian  Corn,  no  shipments.  Freights  rather  higher  :  Ex Exchange  change Exchange  unaltered.  The  next  accounts,  under  the  influence  of  English  advance,  may  be  expected  higher.  The  close  of  the  past  week  furnishes  dull  accounts  from  most  of  the  British  and  Irish  markets  ;  the  deliveries  from  growers  are  increasing  materially  in  both.  At  the  other  side  of  the  Channel  reports  of  Potatoes  continue  very  unfavourable,  and  the  consumptive  demand  for  Indian  corn  restricted  in  con consequence  sequence consequence  ;  prices,  however,  of  this  Grain  nearly  supported  at  their  highest  point  in  anticipation  of  early  renewed  inquiry,  and  a  dearth  of  future  foreign  supply.  The  decline  '  here  on  Friday  has  been  followed  by  further  pressure,  which  resulted  yesteaday  in  sales,  to  a  fair  extent,  of  Flour  at  lower  rates  than  on  Friday.  Wheat  was  less  freely  offered,  though  purchaseable  at  some  decline,  and  the  business  was  limited.  A  few  small  parcels  of  Grain  and  Flour  with  a  moderato  quantity  of  Oatmeal,  include  the  only  arrivals  of  English  and  Irish  produce  into  this  port  since  Tuesday  last  ;  those  from  abroad  during  the  week  consisting  merely  of  5281  qrs.  of  Wheat,  202  qrs.  of  Maize,  with  21,274  barrels  of  Flour  from  the  United  States,  and  2418  sacks  of  the  latter  from  Spain.  At  the  same  time  the  exports  hence  comprise  182  qrs.  of  Oats  to  Australia,  1824  sacks  of  Flour  to  Rouen,  and  820  barrels  to  Antwerp,  while.of  Wheat  and  Flour  shipments  coast coastwise  wise coastwise  and  to  Ireland  are  considerable.  There  has  been  only  a  slender  attendance  of  either  town  or  country  dealers  at  our  Corn  Exchange  this  morning;  the  market  opened  somewhat  stronger  than  yesterday,  but  we  had  a  much  less  active  trade  than  anticipated,  consuming  buyers  keeping  much  on  the  reserve,  and  we  note  the  value  of  wheat  fully  2d  per  bushel,  and  that  of  Flou.  Is  per  barrel  lower  than  last  Tuesday.  The  Farmers  brought  forward  a  large  show  of  Wheat  samples,  generally  in  indifferent  condition,  which  were  taken  sparingly  at  the  reduction.  Malt  and  malting  Barley  are  is  to  2s  dearer.—Beans  and  Indian  Corn  inactive  and  rather  low.  —New  Oats  are  Id  per  bushel,  and  Oatmeal  6d  to  is  per  load  cheaper.—Other  articles  may  be  quoted  much  as  on  this  day  se'nnight,  with  but  moderato  transactions  occurring  in  each.
