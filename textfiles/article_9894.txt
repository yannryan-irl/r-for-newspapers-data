Holme  and  Slater  have  this  day  issued  their  annual  statement  of  the  Timber  Trade  of  the  Mersey  from  which  we  quote  the  following  remarks  :  The  most  remarkable  feature  in  the  trade  is  the  great  advance  which  has  taken  place  in  the  value  of  Quebec  yellow  pine  timber,  and  the  continued  low  price  of  spruce  deals,essentially  building  timber,  which  ought,  therefore,  to  approximate  closely  in  value,  as  was  the  case  in  the  early  part  of  the  year,  bat  owing  to  the  extraordinary  import  of  spruce  deals  (above  the  consumptive  demand)  and,  there therefore  fore therefore  a  large  accumulation  of  stock,  they  have  continued  at  their  low  value  throughout  the  season,  whilst  Quebec  pine,  having  been  imported  sparingly,  has  advanced  from  the  low  price  of  141  per  foot  to  its  present  high  rate.  St.  John  yellow  pine,  during  the  early  part  of  the  import  came  slowly  into  the  market,  and  high  rates  were  obtained  for  this  article,  but  latterly  it  has  been  imported  more  freely,  and  given  way  slightly  in  price.  We  may  record  this  as  alto altogether  gether altogether  a  favourable  year  for  the  importers  and  dealers.  We  refer  to  eachiparticular  article  under  its  separate  head.  The  following  table  shews  the  number  of  vessels,  and  their  tonnage,  employed  in  the  timber  trade  of  the  Mersey  during  the  year,  contrasted  with  those  employed  in  the  previous  one  :  From  January  31st,  1855.  to  39th  January,  1856.

Baltic  330,678  The  Panama  papors,  by  the  West  India  mail,  furnish  news  from  Australia  to  the  2nd  of  Ncv.,  from  Melbourne,  which  is  a  week  later  than  the  accounts  received  direct,  by  the  Black  Ball  mail  ship,  Champion  of  the  Se-:s,  and  affords  another  proof  of  the  desirability  of  estab:ishing  an  Austra Australian  lian Australian  mail  route  by  steamers,  via  Panama.  The  present  is  the  sixth  instance,  during  the  last  few  months,  that  we  have  received  advices  (even  with  a  disjointed  communication)  by  way  of  Panama,  in  advance  of  those  brought  by  the  clipper  mail  ships,  direct.  Is  any  more  conclusive  evidence  wanted  ?  Tha  advises  by  the  Atlantic,  from  New  York,  are  of  a  favourable  character.  Foreign  Exchanges,  after  having  been  depressed,  were  improving.  and  the  quotations  on  London  had  risen  to  1081  to  1081.  The  Dry  Goods  trade  showed  that  the  imports  were  in  excess  of  the  demand,  which  was  said  to  be  the  only  ground  of  uneasiness  in  the  Money  Market.  The  following  is  a  comparative  summary  of  the  import  into  New  York  for  the  week,  and  for  the  corresponding  week  of  1855:  1855.  Manufactures  of  Wool  .  _321,715  Cotton  234,644  Silks  Flax  135,395  Miscellaneous  Total  1856.  350.742  185,291  817,148  86,086  197.204  1,397,644  1,636,471  The  New  York  stock  market  was  buoyant,  and  one  writer  says  Notwithstanding  the  reported  dif difficulties  ficulties difficulties  in  the  foreign  money  markets,  there  is  a  steady  flow  of  British  and  continental  capital  to  this  country  for  investment  in  the  leading  securites  of  our  market.  Many  of  these,  of  a  solid  character,  now  yield  eight  to  twelve  per  cent.  For  Reading  shares  alone,  already  held  largely  in  England,  the  orders  within  the  past  two  weeks  have  been  liberal,  and  the  new  features  of  the  company  now  made  public  will  gradually  operate  upon  foreign  holders  to  induce  them  to  invest  further.  A  dividend  of  ten  per  cent.  will  probably  be  made  on  the  shares  in  July  next,  leaving  a  handsome  balance  for  the  sinking  fund  of  the  The  Freight  market  closed  firmer,  owing  to  increased  offerings  to  Great  Britain  and  reduced  supply  of  unengaged  room.  To  Liverpool  the  engagements  were  large.  Corn  and  wheat,  mostly  the  tormer,  at  Sid  to  Bd,  in  bulk  and  ship's  bags,  closing  with  higher  rates  demanded  and  9d  refused.  The  market,  for  American  Securities  in  London  has  been  active.  There  has  been  more  enquiry  for  Pennsylvania  State  Bonds,  with  few  offering.  Virginia  per  cent  Sterling  Bonds  have  been  wanted,  at  83  and  83i;  6  per  cent  Dollar  Bonds  are  in  a  larger  supply,  and  are  more.  offered.  We  note  an  increased  demand  for  United  States'  Bonds,  at  a  slight  advance.  San  Francisco'  City  Bonds  have  also  been  enquired,  for.  There  are  a  few  small  lots  of  Cleveland,  Chicago,  and  Detroit  City  Bonds  on  the  market,.and  a  large  supply  of  New  Orleans  City.  In  Railroad  Bonds,  we  note  large  . STYLE=superscript  transactions  in  New  York  Central  6  per  cent  and  7  per  cent  Bonds,  in  Erie  Third  Mortgage  and  Sinking  Fund  Bonds;  also  in  Illinois  Central  Construction  and  Free  Land  Bonds,  at  advanced  prices.  Pennsylvania  Central  First  and  Second  Mortgage  and  Michigan  Central  Bonds  have  been  rather  more  euquired  for.  Illinois  Central  Shares'  have  been  done,  at  9  dis.  The  committee  of  Mexican  bondholders  have  received  advices  from  Mr.  Whitehead,dated  Mexico  the  2d  Jan.  The  President  ad  interim,  General  Alvarez,  had  resigned  in  favour  of  General  Comon Comonfort.  fort. Comonfort.  Don  Manuel  Pryno  had  succeeded  Don  Guillermo  Pietro  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  ;  and  Mr.  Whitehead  had  had  a  satisfactory  interview  v.ith  the  former  gentleman.  There  were  45,000  doll.  in  Vera  Cruz,  and  also  a  certain  amount  (perhaps  some  15,000)  in  Tampico,  ready  for  ship shipment  ment shipment  by  the  present  packet,  but  the  weather  prevented  her  from  embarking  those  funds.  The  committee  have  also  a  letter  from  their  agents  in  Mazatlan,  detedll3th  Dec.,  advising  an  additional  shipment  of  12,231  dais,  by  her  Majesty's  steamer  Brisk.  Bs  telegraph  from  Madrid,  it  is  stated  that  the  povernment  Gazette  has  published  the  laws  repilating  the  Credit  Mubilier  society,  and  that  of  the  Spanish  capitalists.  shAccc.unts  from  the  Vienna  Bourse,  by  telegraph,  ow  that  the  Austrian  Funds,  and  other  Securi-  ties  quoted  in  that  market,  have  further  advanced  this  week.  In  the  6  per  cent  Aletallice  there  is  an  improvement  of  2  per  cent,  and  they  are  now  851.  The  New  Loan  is  1046,  and  New  Bank  Stock  has  risen  to  1,000.  The  Austrian  Credit  Mobilier  is  0256,  and  Austrian  Railways  234.  Exchanges  on  London  is  down  to  10.28.,  and  on  Paris  to  124.  The  English  Funds  showed  increased  heaviness  to-day.  Prices  closed  per  cent.  lower  than  yesterday,  the  quotations  standing  thus,  901  90i.  After  the  recognised  hours  a  fresh  decline  of  k  per  cent.  was  quoted.  The  guarded  terms  in  which  the  Queen's  speech  referred  to  the  prospects  of  peace  excited  some  disappointment  amongst  the  speculators.  The  chief  depressing  influence  to  day,  however,  rested  with  the  continued  extra  ordinary  demand  for  money.  In  every  quarter  great  pressure  was  experienced,  and  the  applies  thins  at  the  Bank  are  understood  to  have  been  extremely  heavy.  In  the  Stock  Exchange  the  rate  remains  as  high  as  6  to  7  per  cent.  for  Loans  on  good  securities.  Much  of  this  demand  is  attributable  to  the  requisitions  of  the  Stock  Exchange.  The  fortnightly  settlement  which  concluded  to-day  in  the  House,  was  a  heq.vier  one  than  has  been  noticed  for  the  last  2  or  3  years,  and  has  materially  aggravated  the  pressure  for  money.  This  statement  applies  only  to  Shares  and  Fort  ign  Stocks,  in  which  the  aggregate  transactions  and  the  rise  in  value  have  been  very  extensive.  The  failure  of  another  broker  was  to-day  announc3d  in  the  Stock  Exchange,  making  three  suspensions  arising  out  of  this  settlement.  The  Paris  Bourse  continues  decidedly  firm.  A  further  advance  was  established  in  the  French  Funds  at  the  commence commencement  ment commencement  of  business  this  morning,  but  a  relapse  took  place  in  the  afternoon.  The  Railway  Share  Market  continues  good  in  character.  Neither  the  Settlement  nor  the  fhtness  of  the  Funds  has  exercised  any  material  influence.
