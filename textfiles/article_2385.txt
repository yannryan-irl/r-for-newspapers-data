REVIEW  OF  THE  MARKET,  ECT  45,000  15,000  We  issued  our  last  circular  for  the  Artic  on  the  Ist  inst.  The  sales  since  that  date,  excluding  one  day,  on  which  5,000  bales  were  reported,  have  steadly  kept  down  to  500  bales  daily.  The  feeling  throughout,  with  the  exception  named,  and  which  was  confined  to  two  or  three  ardent  spirits,  has  been  one  of  uniform  excessive  dullness  and  apathy—prices  being  nominally  sustained  by  the  hopes  of  holders  in  receiving  aid  from  the  expec expected  ted expected  improvement  in  tue  Liverpool  market,  and  a  settle settlement  ment settlement  of  the  disquieting  Eastern  question,  in  both  of  which  they  have  been  dissappointed,  and  in  the  dubious  position  of  th  e  present  crop  rests  the  hope  of  continuing  business  near  the  present  currency.  The  mills  at  the  east eastroa  roa eastroa  ct  a STYLE=superscript  iNtiginniS  i STYLE=superscript  sT  e STYLE=superscript  tat  t STYLE=superscript  tAr  are  dueed  from  thirteen  to  eleven.  They  are  stocked  more  largely  than  heretofore,  and  it  is  expected  will  see  the  policy  of  purchasing  later  and  more  cautiously  than  dur during  ing during  the  previous  crop.  The  Canada's  advises,  received  on  13th  inst.,  simply  added  to  the  dull  feeling.  We  ad adjust  just adjust  our  quotations  to  the  rate  accepted:  holders  endeavor  to  wait  for  more,  as  it  would  be  impossible  to  obtain  them  in  quantity.  The  advices  we  have  continued  to  receive  from  the  South,  during  the  past  fortnight,  we  regret  to  say,  have  not  been  favourable  for  the  crop.  The  accounts  of  injury  arising  from  too  much,  moist  weather,  say  rotting  of  the  bolls,  &amp;c.,  have  steadily  continued,  and  extended  over  a  wider  surface.  The  growth  of  the  plant  has  been  luxuriant,  but  the  proportion  of  bolls  has  not  kept  pace  therewith,  and  what  has  been  formed,  being  covered  by  foliage,  the  ripening  process  has  been  retarded  we  think  fully  a  fortnight  as  com compared  pared compared  with  the  past  crop.  At  the  present  time  the  weather  is  not  indicative  of  a  long  season  and  a  killing  frost  during  the  present  month,  may  be  reasonably  looked  for.  The  effect  of  such,  even  at  the  termination  of  the  month,  would  be  to  curtail  the  former  prospect  of  a  large  crop  over  100,000  bales.  After'  a  frost,  we  may  haVe  ripening  weather,  and  bolls  nearly  ripe  may  be  gath  ere  d  after  being  hardened  under  it.  So  much  depends  on  the  character  of  the  weather  after  a  frost,  and  so  largely  can  the  crop  be  benefitted,  or  injured  thereby,  we  think  it  in inadvisable  advisable inadvisable  to  say  it  cannot  reach  3,000,000  bales,  but  the  chances  are  decidedly  against  it.
