"MEXICO,  On  the  11th  September,  the  British  steamer,  Clyde,  arrived  at  Havannah,  from  Vera  Cruz,  bringing  several  passengers,  forced  from  Mexico  by  the  orders  of  Santa  Anna.  The  intelligence  received  by  private  letters,  indicates  a  very  disturbed  political  state,  and  intimates  that  Santa  Anna  feels  anything  but  confidence  in  his  power  to  sustain  his  p?sition.  He  is  progressing  as  rapidly  as  possible  in  the  organization  of  his  armyâ€”to  reach  the  strength  of  80,000  men,  the  drafts  to  cover  all  ages,  from  16  to  50.  Advices  received  at  New  Orleans,  state  that  a  report  had  reached  the  city  of  the  breaking  out  of  hostilities  in  the  Mesilla  Valley,  between  the  United  States  troops  and  the  Mexican  forces.  General  Trias  had  also  received  information  that  a  large  body  - STYLE=superscript  of  American  troops  were  Concentrating  on  the  Rio  Grande,  and  that  they  would  unite  with  those  already  in  the  valley,  in  an  attempt  to  seize  it.  yhese  reports  had  created  .the  most  intense  excitement,  which,  at  the  latest  account,  had  got  to  be  of  so  serious  a  character,  that  the  supreme  Government  had  thought  proper  to  demand  from  Gen.  Gadsden,  the  American  minister,  au  immediate  explanation  of  theintentions  of  the  United  States'  Govern Government,  ment, Government,  in  sending  out  additional  forces  to  occupy  the  Mesilla  Valley  and  vicinity.  The  _Echo  del  Comereio,  published  at  Vera  Cruz,  devotes  several  editorial  articles  to  the  consideration  of  the  American  minister,  and  the  instructions  received  by  him  at  Washington,  and  intimates  that,  unless  it  is  fully  and  clearly  understood  that  the  latter  are  entirely  of  a  pacific  nature,  there  will  be  the  most  imminent  danger  of  a  sudden  commencement  of  hostilities  between  the  two  countries."
