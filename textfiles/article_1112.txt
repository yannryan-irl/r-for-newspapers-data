"FRIVOLOUS  OBJECTIONS  TO  VOTERS.  TO  THE  EDITOR  OF  THE  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES.  SlR,—Having  received  a  letter  from  a  certain  Mr.  Maurice  informing  me  that  my  vote  was  objected  to  for  the  municipal  election,  and  requiring  me  to  be  at  the  Sessions Sessionshouse  house Sessionshouse  to-day  (Saturday),  I  went,  and  found  several  persons  waiting,  like  myself,  to  the  neglect  of  their  business.  While  there,  and  finding  that  my  name  would  not  be  called  till  Monday,  I  had  a  conversation  with  the  redoubtable  Buckmaster,  he  having  objected  to  my  vote  for  the  borough,  and  then  having  withdrawn  his  frivolous  objection.  I  ad addressed  dressed addressed  him  :  he  could,  however,  give  me  no  satisfaction,  say saying  ing saying  it  was  not  his  doing,  but  the  people  who  employed  him  !  I.  said,  If  you  have  withdrawn  your  objection  to  my  vote  in  the  one  instance,  why  not  in  the  other  ?  I  was  not  honoured  with  a  reply.  A  gentleman's  name  happened  just  then  to  be  called,  and  not  being'  present,  his  vote  was  struck  bff  the  list.  Our  worthy  Mayor  said,  in  reference  to  that  case,  that  he  had  seen  the  gentleman  the  whole  of  the  pre previous  vious previous  day  in  the  Court,  and  it  was  a  pity  he  was  not  there,  because  not  being  there  to  substantiate  his  claim,  it  was  not  allowed  I  cannot  help  expressing  my  contempt  for  any  party  who  can,  for  a  political  purpose,  rob  honest  tradesmen  of  their  valuable  time,  and  regret  that  they  are  obliged  to  resort  to  such  paltry  means  to  bolster  up  a  rotten  cause.—  I  am,  Sir,  yours,  &amp;c.,  A  TRADESMAN."
