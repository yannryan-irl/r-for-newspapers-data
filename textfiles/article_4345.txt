"servant,  •  •  To'  John  Harrison,  Esq.,  and  John  Hopkins,  The  accounts  annexed  to  to  this  prostrating  report  are  too  voluminous  for  our  columns  at  present.  The  reader  has  seen  that  the  capital  has  been  wholly  frittered  away.  Not Notwithstanding  withstanding Notwithstanding  the  assertions  as  to  copper  ore,  not  one  penny  credit  is  given  for  the  sale  of  that  metal,  nor  for  the  The  gentlemen,  whose  names  are  attached,  John  and  John  thus  conclude  Your  committee  deem  it  necessary  to  state,  that  the  books  to  which  reference  is  made  in  the  foregoing  report  being  considered  by  the  accountant  indispensable  for  a  complete  investigation,  an  application  was  made  in  le&amp;al  form  to  Absalom  Bennett,  Esq.,  the  purser  of  their  mine,  to  produce  the  said  books,  and  he  in  answer  promised  to  do  so,  but  which  promise  he  ultimately  neglected  to  fulfil.  Your  committee,  influenced  by  a  desire  to  render  to  each  shareholder  a  faithful  statement  of  all  circumstances  connected  with  this  investigation,  beg  to  refer  each  shareholder  to  the  Reports  of  Mr.  Begbie  and  Capt.  Vivian  ;  and  when  a  general  meeting  of  proprietors  takes,  place,  your  committee  will  have  the  pleasure  of  tender tendering  ing tendering  any  further  information  in  their  power  in  and  for  the  fu future  ture future  welfare  of  the  proprietors  The  meeting  adverted  to  is  to  come  off  at  Liverpool  this  day  (Friday.)  There  will  be  a  pretty  .  scene  !  In  Carlisle  there  are  numerous  victims;  no  less,  we  are  told,  than  a  score  or  more.  They  were  assured  that  a  good  thing  awaited  them,  and  some  of  them  bit  to  the  tune  of  £1,200  ;  some  £9OO  ;  some  £BOO,  £6OO,  £4OO  £3OO,  &amp;c.  They  rushed  upon  the  hook  like  a  shoal  of  perch  when  sand  is  thrown  into  the  water.  They  were  told  that  shares  were  a  matter  of  favour.  Nay,  some  were  pulled  in  under  the  guise  of  philanthropy  ;  they  had  shares  ass  boned  almost  as  charity,  and,  till  lat  e  ly,  li  ve  d  in  the  hope  that  their  fortunes  were  made.  Why  do  we  enter  into  these  details  ?  Not,  certainly,  to  exult  oven  those  who  are  suffering  lacerations  in  the  trap,  but  to  add  one  more  to  the  many  warnings  to  be  found  in  the  history  of  railway  and  mining  speculations,  that  it  is  not  only  not  all  gold  that  glitters,  but  that  oftener  indicates  brass  than  copper,  and  silver  lead.  THE  GREAT  BUBBLE  (From  the  same,  October  22.)  The  earth  hath  bubbles  as  the  water  has  ;  these  are  of  --Macbeth.  TO  THE  EDITOR  OP  THE  CARLISLE  PATRIOT  you  permit  me  through  the  medium  Of  your  columns,  to  make  public  a  huge  scheme  which  is  being  now  successfully  carried  out  for  obtaining  money  from  the  pub public  lic public  without  an  equivalent.  The  morality  of  the  transaction  I  must  leave  for  the  public  to  decide  upon,  after  reading  the  following  statements.  The  plan  consists  in  bringing  out  mining  companies,  the  mines  being  in  Cornwall.  The  parties,  whom  we  will  call  A  13  and  Co.,  have  grand  offices  in  London.  The  shares  are  disposed  of  there  by  themselves,  and  also  in  Liverpool  and  the  North  by  means  of  agents.  They  take  on  lease  certain  old  mines,  or  plots  of  land  likely  to  contain  ore,  on  the  usual  terms,  viz.,  1-16  dues  on  ore  raised,  or  thereabouts.  They  then  let  it  be  known  through  private  channels  that  they  ,have  got  some  wonderfully  good  mines,  and  otherwise  act  as  though  they  had  realised  a  fortune.  As  these  have  varied  a  little  in  each  instance,  I  will  give  them  seriatim,  distinguishing  them  by  the  letters  of  the  alphabet.  The  first  was  A  mine  ;  they  informed  their  friends  that  there  was  a  few  shares  to  sell  in  this  valuable  mine  at  £3  each  ;  that  there  were  5,000  shares  to  be  sold,  and  printed  circulars  were  issued,  but  no  particu particulars  lars particulars  as  to  the  financial  affairs  of  the  company.  They  said  there  were  20,000  shares  in  all;  that  5,000  were  disposed  of  to  raise  an  additional  capital  to  carry  on  more  extensive  operations,  which  they  considered  sufficient  for  the  purpose.  The  destiny  of  the  remaining  15,000  was  carefully  kept  out  of  sight  ;  and  they  said,  in  reply  to  a  question  put,  that  the  original  proprietors  will  have  no  advantage  over  Now,  it  appears  that  the  15,000  shares  are  really  free  shares  appropriated  to  themselves,  for  the  good-will  and  previous  outlay  on  the  mine  ;  in  other  words,  £45,000  worth  of  shares.  The  mine  and  all  its  concerns  are  entirely  worked  by  them;  they  are  universal  officers,  but  self-appointed.  No  meeting  of  this  company  was  ever  held,  and  no  accounts  over  publiohod,  although  thoy  havo  boon  oolling  thoir  oharco  above  twelve  months.  The  public,  in  paying  £3  per  share,  are  thus  really  paying  300  per  cent.  premium  ;  and  yet  such  is  the  blind  confidence  in  the  promoters,  that  the  shares  are  now  quoted  at  £5  10s.,  though  no  dividend  has  ever  been  paid.  The  fact  that  the  15,000  shares  are  granted,  or  rather  taken  for  nothing,  is,  I  believe,  at  the  present  moment  unknown  to  most  of  the  shareholders.  Meanwhile  another  concern  is  being  hatched,  which  I  will  call  the  B  mine.  This  was  an  old  mine,  abandoned  by  former  adventurers,  and  was  taken  by  A  B  and  Co.,  in  January,  1851.  This  was  brought  out  as  a  private  com company,  pany, company,  first  in  5,000  shares  of  £3  each,  of  which  1,000  were  sold.  The  £3,000  thus  produced  set  the  company  to  work  ;  but  in  January  this  year,  a  meeting  of  the  company  was  called  by  A  B  and  Co.,  in  London,  to  decide  on  bringing  it  out  as  a  great  public  company.  This  was  agreed  to,  and  it  was  then  reconstituted,  with  50,000  shares  of  30s.  each,  of  which  A  B  and  Co.  were  to  sell  (as  they  had  to  do  the  5,000  in  the  A  mine),  10,000  shares  to  the  public  at  30s.  or  so  many  as  would  realise  £15,000;  10,000  were  given  to  the  holders  of  the  1,000  shares  of  £3  each  in  the  former  company,  and  30,000  were  allotted  to  A  B  and  Co.  for  nothing.  Thus  the  holders  of  the  1,000  shares  each  got  £l5  worth  of  shares  for  his  £3,  and  were  thus  made  ac accomplices.  complices. accomplices.  A  further  arrangement  was  also  made  that  the  £15,000  now  raised,  and  the  £3,000  previously  raised,  should  all  be  entirely  expended  on  the  mine,  and  that  the  gross  proceeds  of  ore  should  be  divided  in  dividends.  This  rule,  I  find,  applies  to  them  all.  Thus.  Nominal  capital.  10,000  shares  sold  for  £15,000,  bring..  .....  £15,000  10,000,  ',  15,000,  to  original  hold holders,  ers, holders,  bring  3,000  45,000,  to  A  B  and  Co  .  nil.  30,000  Nominal  capital,  as  )  75,000  Real  capital  ..  £lB,OOO  per  share  list  In  other  words,  out  of  the  £75,000  nominal  capital,  £57,000  is  at  once  unavailable  for  the  working  of  the  mine.  But  the  arrangement  just  referred  to,  is,  in  other  words,  simply  an  arrangement  that  this  £lB,OOO  of  capital,  found  by  the  few,  shall  be  divided  as  dividend  amongst  the  whole.  Thus,  A  B  and  Co.,  who  found  none  of  it,  get  XlO,BOO  ;  the  original  holders,  who  found  £3,000,  get  £3,600  ;  the  n  ew  shareholders,  who  found  £15,000,  get  £3,600.  Again,  by  the  way  that  A  B  and  Co.  have  worded  the  resolution  re respecting  specting respecting  selling  the  10,000  shares,  it  will  be  seen  that  they  simply  credit  the  company  £15,000,  and  if  they  can  sell  them  at  more,  they  keep  the  remainder  ;  in  other  words,  they  take  the  10,000  shares,  and  add  them  to  their  30,000,  and  credit  the  company  £15,000.  Thus  it  will  be  seen,  as  A  13-and  Co.,  alone  know  the  real  value  of  the  mine,  alone  know  who  the  shareholders  are,  and  make  all  the  transfers,  they  can  go  on,  and  not  only  sell  the  10,000,  but  also  theif  own  30,000  shares,  and  no  one  be  the  wiser.  The  price  of  these  has  been  already  run  up  to  £4  10s.  Taking  7s.  6d.  as  about  the  par  price,  (which  it  really  is,  if  the  capital,  £lB,OOO,  is  divided  among  50,000  shares),  or  1,100  per  cent.  premium,  and  if  they  succeed  in  clearing  out  their  shares—as  why  should  not,  being  much  more  certain  than  waiting  for  the  development  of  the  mine—their  account  will  stand  thus  :  £45,000  16,000  shares,  at  £3,  in  A  mine  Premium  on  above,  now  £2  10s.  per  share,  say  on  an  average,  £1  lOs  ..

The  pros prospectus  pectus prospectus  states  that  Mr.  A.  spent  £6,000  on  the  mine,  which  has  belonged  to  him  for  many  years  —what  the  last  company  spent  we  have  no  information  ;  but  their  own  valuation  in  the  mining  list  is  5,000  shares,  at  £4  each,  or  £20,000,  which  is  evidently  at  least  twice  the  amount  laid  out  in  the  mine,  and  now  they  are  going  to  accept  40,000  free  shares  at  £2  as  their  consideration—or  £BO,OOO  for  what  they  value  at  £20,000.  Of  this  £BO,OOO  worth  of  free  shares  doubtless'  the  holders  of  the  shares  in  the  little  or  first  com company,  pany, company,  will,  as  in  the  13  mine,  receive  a  little  bone  to  pick  to  keep  them  quiet,  but  leaving,  no  doubt,  some  30,000  shares,  or  £60,000  worth  to  A  B  and  Co.
