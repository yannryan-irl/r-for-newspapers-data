PROGRESS  OF  EVENTS  (From  our  Second  Edition  of  Yesterday.)  Further  details  are  given  of  the  battle  of  Sinope.  Although  the  Russian  admiral  knew  the  Turkish  squadron  was  already  inferior  in  force,  he  sent  a  steamer  to  Sebastopol  to  fetch  three  line  of  battle battleships  ships battleships  of  120  guns,  and  did  not  commence  opera operations  tions operations  till  they  had  arrived.  Several  of  the  Turkish  ships  were  blown  up  by  shells.  The  firing  com commenced  menced commenced  between  9  and  10  a.m.,  and  ceased  at  2.  Three  frigates  were  on  flames,  and  the  transports  altogether  sunk.  The  Turkish  portion  of  the  town  was  on  fire,  but,  by  one  of  those  por portents  tents portents  which  only  occur  in  these  sacred  struggles,  the  Russian  bulletin  states  that  the  flames  ne neglected  glected neglected  the  quarter  inhabited  by  the  Greeks.  It  does  not  appear  that  any  portion  of  the  crews  or  treasure  on  board  had  been  landed.  On  the  follow following  ing following  morning,  nothing  remained  of  the  12  vessels  comprising  the  Turkish  squadron,  except  a  sloop,  and  a  corvette  run  ashore,  and  the  Damietta,  Egyp Egyptain  tain Egyptain  frigate,  all  of  which  were  ordered  to  be  burned.  In  these  small  vessels  were  found  the  admiral  Osman  Pacha  wounded  in  the  leg,  a  few  officers,  and  about  80  men.  These  appeared  to  be  the  sole  sur survivors.  vivors. survivors.  It  is  impossible  to  have  further  proof  that  this  catastrophe  was  not  the  result  of  a  casual  en encounter,  counter, encounter,  but  a  deliberate  assault  on  the  vessels  of  Turkey,  and  the  town  of  Sinope,  supposed  to  be  under  the  protection  of  the  combined  fleets.  The  Times  has  a  leading  article  on  the  Russian  bulletins  and  the  religious  thanksgiving,  for  their  so-called  victories,  condemning  in  the  strongest  terms,  their  falsehood  and  hypocrisy.  The  dates  would  show  that  the  bold  and  sea seamanlike  manlike seamanlike  proposal  of  Admiral  Dundas,  to  immedi immediately  ately immediately  pursue  the  Russians  and  cut  them  off  from  Sebastopol,  was  feasible.  The  sharp  though  ineffectual  attack  upon  Fort  Matsehin  on  the  Danube,  removes  meanwhile  all  doubt  from  the  character  which  Russia  gives  this  war.  With  respect  to  the  entry  of  the  combined  fleets  into  the  Black  Sea,  the  article  remarks,  that  a  collision  will  ensue,  when  naval  forces  are  placed  in  such  a  position,  is  extremely  probable  ;  and  the  Emperor  of  Russia,  foreseeing  that  such  a  result  cannot  long  be  avoided,  may  anticipate  it  by  the  declaration  of  a  rupture.  The  manner  in  which  .ese  attacks  have  been  conducted,  and  the  tone  in  which  these  victories  have  been  celebrated,  is  sufficient  proof  that  the  Emperor  will  not  easily  desist  from  the  war  ;  and  though  we  regret  none  of  the  protracted  efforts  which  have  been  made  to  avert  so  great  an  evil,  we  ars  not  the  less  prepared  to  meet  it  in  the  last  resort  by  a  vigorous  resistance."
