"COMMERCIAL  INTELLIGENCE.  (From  Rio  Mercantile  Journal,  Oct.  8.)  REVIEW  FOR  THE  MONTH.  Moderate  imports,  sales  of  these  to  a  fair  extent,  a  full  average  inquiry  for  coffee,  at  advanced  prices  ;  considerable  business  in  exchange  and  increased  facilities  in  the  money  market  were  the  cuaracteristics  of  the  month.  The  Chamber  closed  on  the  25th,  and  as  we  apprehended,  without  having  considered  the  vote  of  the  Senate  against  monopolies,  thus  affording  ailment  to  an  evil  working  sys system—a  tem—a system—a  system  prejudicial  to  all  classes—beneficial  to  no  one  class  of  the  inhabitants  of  this  empire.  In  support  of  the  position  we  have  all  along  taken  upon  this  important  sub subject,  ject, subject,  the  several  national  journals  have  copied  from  a  provin provincial  cial provincial  paper  an  announcement  on  the  part  of  a  firm—one  of  the  leaders  of  the  convention,  to  the  express  effect  that,  whilst  they  are  at  the  same  time  dealers  and  importers,  they  supply  .  parties  in  the  interior,  or  in  other  words,  do  that  which  is  expressly  prohibited  by  the  convention,  and  against  which  proceeding  on  the  part  of  importing  houses,  the  con conventionists  ventionists conventionists  issued  their  bann.  If  any  evidence  be,  after  this  fact,  requisite  to  induce  interference  against  anti-free-trade  principles  then,  indeed,  is  the  case  hopeless—then,  indeed,  must  consumers  cease  to  expect  to  purchase  at  moderate  prices  whilst  each  successive  government  will  have  to  witness  a  reduc reduction  tion reduction  in  the  amount  derived  from  the  duties  on  imports,  the  princi principal  pal principal  source  of  the  revenue  of  the  country.  The  new  National  Bank  shares  are  sought  after  with  great  avidity  ;  the  amount  left-  for  distribution,  atter  the  allotment  to  the  two  banking  companies,  and  the  shares  reserve  for  the  Provinces  is  $6,000,000,  the  applications  for  shares  amount  to  nearly  $50,000,000.  Parties  are  already  actively  canvassing  for  the  Direction.  Let  us  hope  that  the  only  means  to  render  the  Bank  of  Issue  useful  and  advantageous  will  not  be  lost  sight  of,  and  that  the  election  will  be  in  favour  of  those  who  are  best  calcu calculated  lated calculated  by  honesty,  honour,  integrity,  judgment  and  experience,  to  promote  the  advancement  and  insure  the  perpetuity  of  this  vast  establishment.  MONEY.—Discounts  per  pent.  T  Discou  p  n  p  tswere  hoßanks  abundant,  reduced  the  their  current  rate  ratesf  ll  from  fronl STYLE=superscript  Bto  7  per  cent.  late  in  the  month.  Tn  reason  upon  the  cause  of  the  decline  would  be  of  no  utility,  nor  could  we  explain  the  rapid  change  from  an  extraordinary  scarcity  to  an  abundance  equally  extraordinary  and,  possibly,  more  dangerous.  We  have  ever  depreciated  the  excessive  fa facilities  cilities facilities  afforded,  and  the  consequent  inducements  to  over overspeculation;  speculation; overspeculation;  let  us  hope  not  to  see  a  recurrence  of  embar embarrassments  rassments embarrassments  with  which  we  were  threatened  in  May  and  June  last.  EXCHANGE.—The  fluctuations  were  not  considerable,  the  extreme  quotations  having  been  27tc.  284  c.  upon  London.  IMPORT  MARKET--PaovisioNs—Btter—the  earliest  prices  of  Irish  were  560  to  580  rs.,  but  soon  as  supplies  began  to  diminish,  the  value  improved  to  640,  and  although  sales  were  subsequently  effected  at  600  to  620  rs.;  640  rs.  was  the  gener  al  quotation,  and  the  price  paid  for  900  firkins  '  •  the  un  ited  sales  having  amounted  to  140 STYLE=superscript  0  firkins.  French  con continued  tinued continued  in  bad  repute  ;  360  rs.  were  paid  for  an  assorted  par parcel,  cel, parcel,  half  firkins  alone  having  been  taken  at  500  to  460  rs.  per  lb.

FLOUR—Moderate  stocks  in  first  hands  limited  arrivals  early  in  the  month,  and  a  continued  demand  for  re-export  at  sustained  prices.  There  have  arrived  9208  barrels  Balti Baltimore,  more, Baltimore,  2360  Philadelphia,  10,593  'I  rieste,  100  Marseilles,  and  100  Belgian.

COFFEE.—EXPORT  MARKET.—As  in  the  preceding  month  contrary  to  every  reasonable  expectation,  the  transactions  were  important,  and  prices  advanced  '2OO  rein.  Early  and  until  late  in  the  month,  the  quotations  were  almost  without  variation,  but  soon  as  advises  to  24th  August  were  received  by  the  Brazilieria  steamer  on  the  21st,  an  improvement  of  100  refs  was  noted,  and  on  the  26th  the  highest  prices  were  paid  there,  having  prevailed  since.  The  sales  were  of  importance  on  the  12th  and  14th,  but  the  most  extensive  occurred  from  the  19th  to  25th,  alter  which  period  supplies  were  less  free  than  they  previously  had  been.  The  earliest  quotations  for  assortments  were,  for  Europe,  45400  to  45200  ;  for  the  United  States,  45200  to  45300.
