"by  means  of  Mr.  Bennett's  and  Messrs.  Bennett  and  Carr's  acceptances.  the  merchants'  bills  there  is  one  from  Mr.  A.  Bennett  for  £2B  for  timber,  sold  by  him  to  the  company,  and  several  from  Messrs.  Bennett  and  Carr  for  supplies;  but  I  am  assured  by  Mr.  Webster  that  such  supplies  have  no  profit  charged  upon  them  ;  looking  to  the  position  Mr.  Bennett  holdsinthe  company,  I  respectfully  submit  that  such  dealings  would  be  better  avoided  for  the  future.  There  are  one  or  two  bills  for  stationery  among  the  dis disbursements,  bursements, disbursements,  but  not  of  sufficient  amount  to  induce  me  to  raise  any  question  upon  them;  beyond  simply  stating  that  I  do  not  consider  similar  bills  ought  to  be  allowed  in  future,  as  this  item  is  professed  to  be  included  in  the  charge  of  £350  per  annum  for  office  expenses,  stationery,  postages,  and  general  management.  Iwould  suggest  that  in  future  a  banking  account  should  be  opened  for  this  company,  to  which  should  paid  all  money  received  without  exception;  and  further  that  a  regular  cash  book  should  be  kept,  from  which  the  cost  book  should  be  made  up[monthly.—l  remain,  gentlemen,  your  most  obedient  G.  C.  BEGBIE."
