DISTRESSING  SUICIDE  BY  A  MISER.—An  inquest  was  held  on  Wednesday,  at  the  Wheat  Sheaf  Inn,  Lloyd Lloydstreet,  street, Lloydstreet,  Holme,  touching  the  death  of  Mary  Bailey,  aged  63  years,  widow  of  Henry  Baileys  of  Manchester,  confectioner,  lying  dead  at  55,  Hargreaves-street,  Holme,  before  Edward  Herford,  Esq.,  coroner  for  the  city  of  Manchester,  and  a  respectable  jury.  William  Lund,  druggist,  stated  that  he  lodged  with  the  deceased.  The  previous  morn morning  ing morning  abont  9  o'clock,  he  left  her  in  the  house  alone.  Nothing  particular  passed  between  them,  b  u  t  h  e  t  o  ld  her  about  what  time  he  should  be  at  home  for  dinner.  He  went  home  about  past  one  o'clock,when  he  knocked  at  the  door,  but  no  answer  was  returned.  After  trying  to  get  in  without  avail,  we  borrowed  a  ladder,  and  got  in  at  his  bedroom  window,  which  was  the  only  window  unfastened.  He  got  in,  and  found  the  deceased  with  a  hankerchief  round  her  neck,  and  fixed  to  the  bed  •post.  On  seeing  that,  he  did  not  cut  her  down,  but  went  down  stairs  and  let  in  a  man  below.  She  was  taken  off  the  bed-post  and  laid  on  her  own  bed.  .Deceased  complained  of  her  chest  being  bad  on  Sunday:  •  •  She  seemed  -in  great  trouble  within  the  last  fortnight,  as,.  (she  had  told  -witness  several  times)  she  could  not  get  in  money  that  was  owing  to  her,  and  that  it  was  enough'  (she  said)  to  drive  any•  one  crazy.  She  took  nothing  to  speak  of  in  the  way  of  drink.  She  was  short  of  the  necessaries  of  life,  in  consequence  of  not  having  money.  Her  son  lives  at  Ashley,  in  Cheshire,  and  wanted  her  to  go  over  and  live  with  him.  She  was  short  of  food  in  the  house  several  -  times  last  week,  and  .was  unsettled  in  her  mind.  Walter  Bailey,  of  Ashley,  stated  that  •  be  was  a  shoemaker,  and  that  . STYLE=superscript  lie  had  not  seen  the  deceased,  his  mother,  for  3  weeks.  She  told  him-she  was  in  , STYLE=superscript  great  distress,  owiitg  to  money  due  to  her-not  coming  in,  and  he  wanted  her  to  come  and  live  with  him.  She  had  money,  in  the  bank,  but  was  miserly-minded,  and  pinched  herself  because  she  could  not  get  her  debts  in.  That-seemed  to  prey  upon  her  mind.
