The  two  great  questions  are,  will  Dannenberg  have  50,000  or  60,000  men  to  employ  on  such  an  expedition,  and  what  will  be  the  conduct  of  the  Servians  Should  the  Russians  really  entertain  any  idea  of  crossing  the  river  at  Radujevatz,  and  of  proceed proceeding  ing proceeding  by  way  of  Nissa  to  Sophia,  the  Turks  are  pre prepared  pared prepared  to  receive  them,  for  an  entrenched  camp,  surrounded  by  three  rows  of  palisades,  has  been  formed  at  Nissa.."
