"THE  NORTHER':  - STYLE=superscript  DAILY  TIMES.  WEDNESDAY,  OCTOBER  26,  1853  while  the  supply  upon  the  market  has  been  less  Most  of  the  banks  have,  in  a  measure,  curtailed  their  amount  of  discounts,  and  even  what  they  do  is  done  at  very  exhorbitant  rates,  say  from  10  to  18  per  cent.  On  the  receipt  of  the  Canada's  news,  by  telegraph  - STYLE=superscript  from  Halifax,  late  on  in  the  day  of  Thursday  a  most  severe  stringency  - STYLE=superscript  arose  in  money  circles,  which  almost  ,  amounted  to  a  . STYLE=superscript  panic.  The  failure  which  wats  announced  on  that  day  of  one  of  our  Wall-street  brokers,  (Mr.  Simeon  Draper,)  had  an  effect  upon  the  business,  in  the  street,  and  the  day  closed  heavily,  probably  the  darkest  day  in  Wall  Street  that  has  been  ex experienced  perienced experienced  this  year.  The  Stock  Market  fell  .off  considerably  in  almost  all  descriptions  from  three  to  five,  and  even  seven  per  cent.  On  Friday  in  consequence,  of  further  news  by  the  Canada  tele telegraphed  graphed telegraphed  from  Halifax,  which,  was  less  unfavorable,  the  market  for  money  was  a  shade  better,  and  stocks  looked  up  a  little,  but  closed  at  from  four  to  five  per  cent  lower  than  on  Wednesday,  for  nearly  all  descriptions.  The  market  for  breadstuffs  has  again  advanced  under  the  advices  brought  out  by  the  Canada,  but  the  transactions  have  not  been  large,  shippers  are  inclined  to  await  their  private  letters:  most  of  the  transactions  have  been  -made  for  future  deli  Very.  The  increased  rates  may  be  quoted  at  25  cents-  for  flour,  and  4  cents  onl  wheat.  The  stock  on  hand  is  limited  at  present,  but  as  the  winter  draws  upon  us,  the  supplies  will  be  forced  upon  the  market.  The  cotton  market,  owing  to  the  continued  un unfavourable  favourable unfavourable  advices  from  Europe,  continues  languid,  and  prices  drooping.  Notwithstanding,  the  reports  froin  the  south,  of  the  shortness  of  the  crop,  the  sales  have  not  averaged  400  bales  per  day,  Tor  the  last  week  or  two.  In  the  provision  markk  we  have  to  notice  an  active  demand  for  pork,  at  rather  higher  prices.  In  other  articles  there  is  no  change.  Freights  continue  extravagently  high,  to  Liver Liverpool  pool Liverpool  flour  is  quoted  at  3s.  6d.  to  4s.  per  barrel,  and  wheat  14d.  to  15d.  per  bushel.

The  scanty  stock  and  light  re receipts  ceipts receipts  have  induced  factors  to  advance  their  claims,  which  have  checked  operations.  A  few  parcels  were  sold  at  ir irregular  regular irregular  prices.  COTTON—The  business  of  the  day,  as  of  the  entire  week,  has  , STYLE=superscript  been  qUite  insignificant;  as  shippers  have  avoided  the  market,  and  the  home  inquiry  has  been  very  limited.

Subsequently,  with  a  rise  in  freights  and  an  inclination  among  buyers  to  await  the  arrival  of  their  private  correspondence,  some  reaction  occurred,  and  less  vigour  was  displayed  by  the  market,  as  well  as  by  prices,  which  slightly  declined.  At  the  close,  however,  we  observe  a  livelier  and  better  feeling  in  the  trade,  the  tendency  being  decidedly  upward.  The  day's  movehients  .  comprise  21,000  bbls.

REVIEW  OF  THE  MARKET,  ECT.  ..  45,000  16,000  We  issued  our  last  circular  for  the  Artie  on  the  Ist  inst  The  sales  since  that  date,  excluding  one  day,  on  which  5,000  bales  were  reported,  have  steadly  kept  down  to  500  hales  daily.  The  feeling  throughout,  with  the  exception  named,  and  which  was  confined  to  two  or  three  ardent  spirits,  has  been  one  of  uniform  excessive  dullness  and  apathy—prices  being  nominally  sustained  by  the  hopes  of  holders  in  receiving  aid  from  the  expec expected  ted expected  improvement  in  the  Liverpool  market,  and  a  settle settlement  ment settlement  of  the  disquieting  Eastern  question,  in  both  of  which  they  have  been  dissappointed,  apd  in  the  dubious  position  of  thepresent  crop  rests  the  hope  of  continuing  business  near  the  present  currency.  The  mills  at  the'east the'eastward,  ward, the'eastward,  have  for  some  time  past  been  obliged  to  concede  so  much  to  their  hands,  that  the  hours  of  labor  are  re reduced  duced reduced  from  thirteen  to  eleven.  They  are  stocked  more  largely  than  heretofore,  and  it  is  expected  will  see  the  policy  of  purchasing  later  and  more  cautiously  than  dur during  ing during  the  previous  crop.  The  Canada's  advices,  received  on  13th  inst.,  simply  added  to  the  (lull  feeling.  We  ad adjust  just adjust  our  quotations  to  the  rate  accepted:  holders  endeavor  to  wait  for  more,  as  it  would  be  impossible  to  obtain  them  in  quantity.  The  advises  we  have  continued  to  receive  from  the  South,  during  the  past  fortnight,  we  regret  to  say,  have  not  been  favourable  for  the  crop.  The  accounts  of  injury  arising  from  too  much  Moist  weather,  say  rotting  of  the  bolls,  &amp;c.,  have  steadily  continued,  and  extended  over  a  wider  surface.  The  growth  of  the  plant  has  been  luxuriant,  but  the  proportion  of  bolls  has  not  kept  pace  therewith,  and  what  has  been  formed,  being  covered  by  foliage,  the  ripening  process  has  been  retarded  we  .  think  fully  a  fortnight  as  com compared  pared compared  with  the  past  crop.  At  the  present  time  the  weather  is  not  indicat►ve  of  a  long  season  and  a  killing  frost  during  the  present  month,  may  be  reasonably  looked  for.  The  effect  of  such,  even  at  the  termination  Of  the  month,  would  be  to  curtail  the  former  prospect  of  a  large  crop  over  100,000  bales.  After  a  frost,  we  may  have  ripening  weather,  and  bolls  nearly  ripe  may  be  gathered  after  being.  hardened  under  it.  So  much  depends  on  the  character  of  the  weather  after  a  frost,  and  so  largely  can  the  crop  be  benefitted,  .or  injured  thereby,  we  think  it  in inadvisable  advisable inadvisable  to  say  it  cannot  reach  3,000,000  bales,  but  the  chances  are  decidedly  against  it  'l'.
