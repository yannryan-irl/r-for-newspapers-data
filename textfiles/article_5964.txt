Then,  the  necessity  for  the  caution  and  the  pr  u STYLE=superscript  to  of  which  he  spoke  so  obviously,  recommended  itself,  we  think  it  would  be  always  attended  to  and  practised•  e  4  is  had  frequently  regrett  e  d  very  d  eep  l  y,  w  h  en  he  obserc.„atilff,  many  Englishmen,  who  were  fine  labourers,  and  _,:.  ;t  sole  good  fellows  a  disposition  to  be  what  he  might  call,'&#34;Tbef  speaking  individually,  a  little  reckless.
