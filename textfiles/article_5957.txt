Tins  DAY—Morning,  1111.  4m....  Afternoon,  11h.  24m.  THURSDAY,  DECEMBER  15,  1853.  THE  defects  and  disorders  in  our  social  and  political  systems  which  led  to  the  introduction  of  the  continental  system  of  police  have  not  been  in  the  slightest  degree  removed  or  prevented.  The  bludgeon  and  the  tread-mill—the  mask  and  water-gruel—the  straps,  cats,  and  all  the  other  implements  of  torture,  punishment,  and  death,  have  failed  to  correct  loose  habits  or  to  prevent  mime.  When  the  introduction  of  the  police  force  now  in  existence  took  place,  the  most  solemn  assurance  was  given  to  the  public  by  statesmen  enjoying  the  confidence  of  the  country,  that  it  was  a  branch  of  the  civil  service  which  should  at  all  times  be  held  under  the  most  rigid  restrictions,  and  never  suffered  to  infringe  on  the  constitutional  rights  of  the  subject.  The  probability,  and  indeed  possibility,  of  any  such  promise  being  kept,  was  looked  upon  at  the  time  it  was  made  with  great  doubt,  and  in  many  cases,  with  a  positive  certainty  of  its  open  and  flagrant  violation.  The  police  once  established,  the  pledge  was  speedily  forgotten,  and  legislation  soon  found  means  for  extending  the  power  of  the  force  beyond  all  constitutional  limits.  And  what  do  we  find  ?  The  good  old  English  aphorism  house  is  my  is  but  a  dreamy  delusion,  which  any  scoundrel  receiving  a  pound  a  week  from  the  pockets  of  the  public  may  at  a  moment  demon demonstrate  strate demonstrate  with  the  utmost  impunity,  by  breaking  in  one's  door  or  walking  in  at  a  window.  Our  mer.  chants  and  traders,  the  very  sinews  of  the  Empire,  are  classes  which  were  once  jealously  guarded  by  the  legislature  ;  but  now  a  shadow  on  a  wall  re resembling  sembling resembling  the  ghost  of  something  tangible,  and  which  looks  anything  but  what  it  really  is—is  held  to  be  a  sufficient  justification  fur  a  policeman  to  walk  into  a  counting-house  and  drag  its  inmates  to  the  Brideweil,  like  common  thieves.  Our  shop shopkeepers  keepers shopkeepers  are  the  indispensable  adjuncts  of  com commerce,  merce, commerce,  and  their  taste  and  enterprise  give  grandeur  to  our  cities,  while  their  character  imparts  a  high  moral  tone  to  society.  And  yet  a  tradesman  or  a"
