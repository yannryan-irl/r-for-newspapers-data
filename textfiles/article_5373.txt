"TO  CORRESPONDENTS.  We  are  concerned  to  be  obliged  to  ask  certain  correspon correspondents  dents correspondents  to  write  on  one  side  of  their  pages  only—we  really  thought  that  at  this  period  of  .  the  Nineteenth  century,  every  man  could  appreciate  and  observe  this  necessary  direction.  Our  'Arts  •  Manchester,  has  a  keen  appreciation  of  criticism,  and  is  ready  to  give  a  reason  for  the  (artistic)  faith  that  is  in  him.

Whatever  is  intended  for  insertion  must  be  authenticated  by  the  name  and  address  of  the  writer;  not  necessarily  for  publication,  but  as  a  guarantee  of  his  good  f  a  ith.  We  cannot  undertake  to  return  rejected  communications.  All  communications,  Books  for  Review,  etc.,  to  the  Editor  must  be  addressed  to  the  Publisher,  CHARLES  WILLMER,  'and  those  from  London  may  be  sent  to  the  care  of  Messrs.  Simpkin,  Marshall,  and  Co."
