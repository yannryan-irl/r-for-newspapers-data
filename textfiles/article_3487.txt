DISPUTE'  BETWEEN  THE  CITY  OF  DUBLIN  STEAM  PACKET  COMPANY,  AND  THE  CHESTER  AND  HOL  Y  HE-AD  I€A4L  WAY  UOMP  ANY_  The  half-yearly  meeting  of  tbe  City  of  Dublin  steam  Packet  Company  took  place  in  Dublin,  on  _  , STYLE=superscript  ,londay..  Sir.  J.  K.  James  in  the  chair.  The  greater  part  of  the  Report  was  taken  up  in  referring  to  the  dispute  with  the  Chester  and  Holyhead  Railway  Company.  On  this  subject  the  Report  says  ;  At  the  last  meeting  of  proprietors  the  directors  commu communicated  nicated communicated  the  progress  of  the  negotiations  with  the  Chester  and  Holyhead,  and  London  and  North  Western  Railway  Companies,  and  of  the  interruption,  by  those  parties,  to  some  arrangements  which  had  been  agreed  to  under  their  seals.  The  directors  have  now  to  state  that  all  efforts  on  their  part  to  induce  the  railway  companies  to  submit  any  ques questions,  tions, questions,  arising  out  of  the  sealed  agreement,  to  settlement  by  arbitration,  have  proved  unavailing.  This  is  the  more  to  be  regretted,  and  is  the  more  indefensible,  from  the  fact,  that  that  mode  of  settling  di-putes  had  not  only  been  expressly  provided  for  by  the  sealed  heads  of  agreement,  but  had  ac actually  tually actually  been  requested  by  the  'directors  of  the  Chester  and  Holyhead  Company.  The  reluctance  subsequently  .  mani manifested,  fested, manifested,  and  the  refusal  finally  given  to  adopt.  the  fair  prin prin  - prin  eiple  of  arbitration,  must  necessarily  lead  to  the  conviction  that  the  railway  company  felt  too  sensibly  the  groundless groundlessness  ness groundlessness  of  their  views  to  allow  of  their  trusting  their  case  in  the  hands  of  any  disinterested  and  impartial  tribunal  for  de deeis;on.  eis;on. deeis;on.  The  -  directors  of  the  Chester  and  Holyhead  Company  scon  afterwards  proceeded,  in  direct  violation  of  their  sealed  agreement  with  this  company,  to  discontinue  complying  With  such  parts  of  it  as  they  considered  not  to  be  in  accor accordance  dance accordance  with  their  own  interests  ;  while  the  London  and  North  Western  Company  declined  to  fulfil  their  engage engagemilts  milts engagemilts  with  our  company  for  the  establishment  of  the  same  through  rates  for  goods  as  well  as  for  .  passengers,  by  way  of  Live-pool,  as  had  been  previously  in  operation  on  the  Holyhead  line.  This  breach  of  agreement  might  have  rendered  it  diffi difficult  cult difficult  to  maintain  our  goods  traffic,  had  not  the  friends  and  supporters  of  the  company,  and  the  public  generally,  refrained  from  pressing  for  the  adoption  of  the  through  booking  system,  and  which  (in  perfect  reliance  on  the  English  railways  carrying  'out  in  good  faith  their  engage engagements)  ments) engagements)  the  directors  had  expected  to  have  established  via  Liverpool.  is,  however,  satisfactory  to  state  that  there  are  other  lines  and  modes  of  conveyance  from  the  great  manu manufacturing  facturing manufacturing  towns  of  Lancashire  and  Yorkshire  to  Liverpool,  equally  advantageous  to  the  pubtic,  and  which,  being  equally  interested  with  our  company  in  retaining  the  traffic  in  its  accustomed  channels,  the  directors  are  now  working  inharmonious  co-operation  with  them  on  the  through  booking  system.  It  is  right  to  communicate  to  the  proprietors,  that  a  few  days  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  negotiations  which  were  soon  after  ratified  under  the  respective  seals  of  the  Chester  and  Holyhead  and  London  and  North  Western  Companies,  a  letter  was  received  from  the  Chairman  of  the  Chester  and  Holyhead  Company,  in  which  he  stated  that  there  was  no  desire  on  their  part  to  divert  to  Holyhead  any  of  our  Liverpool  traffic  ;  their  object  being,  to  cultivate  a  new  traffic,  none  of  which  went  in  the  vessels  of  our  Company.  With  such  a  pledge,  your  directors  felt  neither  difficulty  nor  hesitation  in  entering  into  the  proposed  traffic  arrange arrangements.  ments. arrangements.  The  directors  are  unwilling  to  impute  to  the  Chair Chairman  man Chairman  of  the  Chester  and  Holyhead  Company  a  deliberate  intention  of  missleading,  or  of  lulling  them  into  a  false  state  of  security,  but  they  feel  abundantly  warranted  in  maintain maintaining  ing maintaining  that,-  after  having  given  so  distinct  an  assurance  of  not  interfering  with  our  goods  traffic,  he  should  in  good  faith  have  refrained  from  seeking  to  divert  our  Liverpool  trade  to  Holyhead,  as  soon  as  the  arrangements  of  his  company  were  ripe  for  the  attempt.  Happily  the  attempt  met  with  but  limited  success.  When  your  directors  obtained  the  mail  contract  they  felt  called  on  to  perform  it  with  the  utmost  regard  to  the  public  convenience  ;  and  influenced  by  this  motive  they  did  not  hesitate,  notwithstanding  the  reduction  in  the  fares,  to  accede  to  the  ioroposal  made  by  the  directors  of  the  Chester  and  Holyhead  Company  in  1851,  that  the  through  tickets  should  be  made  available  in  the  mail  packets  on  the  same  terms  as  by  the  morning  express  boats  of  the  railway  com company.  pany. company.  Your  directors  aye  never  since  interfered  with  any  of  those  through  booking  arrangements,  all  having  been  left  in  the  hands  of  the  railway  boards,  and  when  the  differences  took  place  between  the  companies  no  retaliatory  measure  of  terminating  an  arrangement  so  acceptable  to  the  public  was  adopted  on  the  part  of  this  company.  The  directors  of  the.  Chester  and  Holyhead  Company  have,  however,  recently  given  public  notice  that  from  the  let  December  next,  they  will  confine  the  through  booking  system  to  their  own  boats.  Your  directors  have  considered  that  the  effect  of  this  pro proceeding  ceeding proceeding  will  be  to  induce  a  considerable  portion  of  the  traffic  to  adopt  the  cheaper  route  via  Liverpool,  have  not  hesitated  to  decide  on  sailing  the  passenger  vessels  from  Kingston  harbour  every  evening  as  heretofore  (Sunday  excepted.)"
