Yesterday,  with  an  increased  inquiry  for  ex export,  port, export,  there  was  a  slight  reaction,  the  market  closing  firmly  at  our  revised  quotations,  which  show  a  decline  of  6  cents  on  the  low  and  medium  grades.  The  betetr  descriptions  have  been  very  active  for  home  use,  particularly  for  the  eastward,  and  prices  for  these  are  relatively  higher  than  for  the  common  qualities.  Canada,  with  a  steady  good  demand,  remains  without  material  variation  —the  sales  are  2800  brls.  at  $7  to  $7,061,  in  bond.

Our  quotations  show  a  decline  of  2  to  3  cents  on  the  common  descriptions,  but  prime  parcels,  which  are  scarce,  are  without  particular  change—sales  33,500  bushels  common  to  prime  white  Canada  at  $1  60  to  $1  75,  in  bond;  40,600  ordinary  to  prime  white  Gennesse,  $1  75  to  $1  81;  :2,500  good  to  white  Pennsylvania,  $1  734  to  $1  75;  50,000  common  to  good  white  Michigan,  $1  70  to  $1  75  ;  7  ,  00  0  goo  d  w  hi  te  'Western,  to  arrive,  $1  67;  16,400  or  di  nary  to  good  wh  i  te  Ohio,  $1  64  2  to  $1  68;  3,000  mixed  do.,  $1  50  ;  3,100  fair  white  Southern,  $1  65  ;  150,500  red  and  mixed  Western  and  Upper  Lake,  $1  46  to  $155;  and  600  red  Long  Island,  $1  44.

PROVISIONS.—With  increased  receipts,  and  a  moderate  demand,  western  mess  and  prime  pork  declined  25  to  371  cents,  but  there  was  more  doing  at  decline—sales  3875  brls,  the  market  closing  heavily  at  quotations;  other  descriptions  are  scarce,  and  quotations  entirely  nominal.

FREIGHTS.—The  market  to  Great  Britain  and  the  conti continent  nent continent  is  scarcely  so  firm  since  the  arrival  of  the  Baltic,  though  rates  have  not  varied  materially.
