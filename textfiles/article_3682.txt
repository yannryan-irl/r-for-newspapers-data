Russian  paper  publishes  an  account  of  the  affair  at  Isatchka,  received  by  the  Czar,  which  states  that  eight  gun  boats  and  two  war  steamers,  in  ascending  the  Danube,  were  fired  on  by  the  Turkish  forts,  near  Isatchka,  but  that  they  returned  the  fire  with  success,  and  arrived  at  their  destination  On  this  occasion,  it  adds,  Captain  Lieu Lieutenant  tenant Lieutenant  Varpakhovsky  and  six  men  were  killed,  and  46  wounded.  The  Emperor  has  rewarded  several  of  the  combatants  with  the  military  order.  The  Prussian  Moniteur,  in  its  account  of  the  af affair  fair affair  of  the  2nd,  says  that  the  Russian  cavalry  could  not  act  in  consequence  of  the  marshy  nature  of  the  ground.  Prince  Gortschakoff  had  congratulated  the  troops  on  the  gallantry  they  displayed.  The  Patrie  says  that  it  was  the  village  of  Isatchka,  which  is  built  of  wood,  and  not  the  fort,  which  was  set  fire  to  by  the  Russians.  Accounts  from  Constantinople  of  the  3rd  inst.,  received  by  telegraph,  state  that  the  Turks  have  taken  the  Russian  fortress  on  the  Shefkatil  by  storm.  A  report  of  the  entry  of  the  Turks  into  Bucharest  has  been  circulated  in  Paris,  and  the  fact  is  re regarded  garded regarded  as  probable.

The  Turks  occupied  strong  positions  on  the  Danube.  The  Gazette  d'  Augsburg  announces,  as  on  the  authority  of  the  British  Consul  at  Thessalonica,  that  a  massacre  had  been  perpetrated  by  the  Turks  on  fifteen  hundred  Christians  ;  but  the  English  Ambassador  has  informed  the  Nouvelle  Gazette  de  Prusse  that  no  British  agents  in  those  countries  was  cognisant  of  such  a  report.  The  Paris  correspondent  of  the  Globe,  writing  on  Friday  evening,  says  It  was  reported  to-day  at  the  Bourse  that  an  account  had  been  received  of  another  battle  between  the  Turks  and  the  Rus Russians,  sians, Russians,  in  which  the  former  were  signally  defeated.  I  cannot,  however,  trace  this  rumour  to  any  source  worthy  of  credit;  and  am  assured  by  a  gentleman  of  the  Foreign-office  that  no  news  of  the  kind  has  reached  the  government.  It  would  not  be  surpris surprising,  ing, surprising,  however,  if  the  Russians  in  larger  numbers  than  the  Turks  should  have  fallen  upon  a  portion  of  the  army  of  Omer  Pacha  and  been  victorious.
