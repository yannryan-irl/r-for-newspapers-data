PALE  ALE.—  The  attention  of  Hotel  Keepers,  and  of  the  Trade  generally  in  Liverpool,  is  respectfully  invited  to  TETLEY'S  EAST  I  VIA  PALE  ALE,  which  has  established  a  first-rate  reputation  in  the  Metropolis,  and  will  be  found  to  compare  advantageously  both  in  Quality  and  pric  •  with  the  finest  brands,  without  exception,  to  be  found  in  the  market.  Reference  is  requested  to  the  following  Extracts  from  Professor  Muspratt's  Work  on  Chemistry,  noticed  in  the  Glasgow  Herald,  August  28th.  1854  :  Chemistry.  Theoretical,  Practical,  and  Analytical,  as  applied  to  the  Arts  and  Manufactures.  By  Dr.  Mnspratt,  P.R.S.E  ,  M.R.I.A.  Parts  6to  9  bleu  ive.  G:asgow  :  William  Mackenzie.  The  following  extract  upon  a  popular  subject  may  be  interesting  to  our  readers  :  or  East  India  Ale  is  nothing  more  than  beer  made  front  worts  extracted  from  the  palest  malt  and  boiled  with  the  palest  and  best  hops.  Every  attention  is  given  to  the  selection  of  these  materials,  in  order  to  ensure  the  pale  colour  peculiar  to  this  ale.  •  The  only  localities  where  this  excellent  beverage  is  produced  Ira  large  quantities  are  Burton,  London,  Glasgow,  and  Leeds.  In  the  latter  place  a  very  large  quantity  of  Pale  Ale  has  for  some  years  been  brewed  by  Messrs.  Tetley  and  Son.  Tetley,  like  those  of  Burton—both  of  the  Ist  er  of  which  were  .  analysed  by  the  ratfon—is  their  -  The  pecu'iar  excellence  of  the  ales  of  the  Messrs.  also  keeping  quality,  waters  by  tt  eale  b  •  hops,  so  often  lost  •  pale  brewer,  not.  remarkable  ab  a STYLE=superscript  l  s STYLE=superscript  e  cafe  flavour  of  the  ,  t  eftorts  to  secure  it.

Brewing,  it  is  well  known,  has  been  long  cvried  on  in  Bavaria  on  these  principles;  but  hitherto  there  has  existed  an  insuperable  objection  to  their  a  'option  by  the  more  extensive  firms  of  this  country,  on  account  of  the  great  length  of  time  required  for  perfect  attenuation.  This  difficu'ty,  however,  would  appear  to  be  at  length  ov-  rcome,  the  fermentations  being  now  finishe  in  as  short  a  time  as  by  the  old  mod  :  ti  e  hop  flavour  8  also  preserved,  and  indi•eri  it  may  be  safely  as•  erted  ti.  t  its  oeli oelicate  cate oelicate  aroma  is  never  more  surely  destroyed  than  by  high  and  tny.  bulent  fermentatiou.  This  new  process  of  brewing  pale  ale  has  also  the  advantage  of'  affording  g  rea  t  er  pu  i  ty  of  f  r  ,  grance,  it  being  well  known  that  the  dissolution  of  balm  by  alcohol,  the  result  of  which  may  oft  , STYLE=superscript  n  be  detected  by  the  yea-  ty  flavour  of  the  ale,  is  much  accelerated  by  high  temperatures,  Goo  .  water,  :s  previously  stated,  is  indispen indispensable  sable indispensable  in  a  brewery,  for  so  , STYLE=superscript  ,nd  ale  cannot  be  brewed  with  water  not  advted  for  the  purpose.
