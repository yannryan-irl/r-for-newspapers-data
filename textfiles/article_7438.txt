"hii  own  resources  for  success.  If  it  be  really  so  we  may,  ere  long,  expect  to  hear  of  some  important  movements  in  the  East.  The  weakening  of  the  garrison  of  Eupatoria,  and  the  withdrawing  of  troops  from  the  camp  before  Sebastopol  to  reinforce  the  Turks  in  Asia  Minor,  will  doubtless  be  seized  by  PRINCE  GORTSCHAKOFF  as  a  favourable  opportu-  nity  for  commencing  offensive  operations..  That  he  has  not  done  so,  before  appears  strange  ;  but  his  inaction  will  be  accounted  for,  sooner  or  later,  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  state  of  the  weather  may  be  such  as  to  prevent  his  bringing  his  artillery  into  action,  or  it  may  be  that  he  thinks  it  advisable  to  allow  the  Allies  to  weaken  their  strength  as  much  as  they  please  before  he  moves.  But,  unless  he  allows  GENERAL  11r  JRAVIEFF'S  successful  diversion  to  be  entirely  thrown  away,  and  he  leaves  that  Commander  to  be  overwhelmed  by  numbers,  in  2,  he  must  att attn  n attn  the  C  npt  something  to  keep  the  aea  ful  employ  aunica  ,  it  is  probable  hn  ived  considerable  reinforcemc  is  within  toria,  x  main  body  and  Ear  dep  .T.-EYE  AIS  a  man  u  i;  qFIRMART,  N0.  * STYLE=superscript  90,  Hurh  Neill.

Nothing  more  has  transpired  concerning  the  formation  of  a  French  transatlantic  steam-boat  company,  to  ply  between  Havre  and  New  York.  The  commission  called  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  at  the  former  seaport,  to  examine  the  several  com companies  panies companies  who  have  put  forward  tenders  for  this  object,  have  not  come  to  any  conclusion  yet,  but  it  is  believed  that  ultimately  it  will  be  a  question  of  fusion  amongst  the  several  companies  interested.  There  is  little  doubt  but  that  the  formation  of  such  a  company  would  be  advantageous  to  the  trade  of  France,  but  it  is  a  question  whether  it  would  pay.  The  result  of  a  previous  attempt  some  years  ago  was  most  unsatisfactory,  and  proved  a  losing  speculation  on  the  part  of  the  shareholders.  The  Revenue  Returns  for  the  year  for  nine  months,  and  for  the  quarter  ending  yesterday,as  compared  with  the  cor corresponding  responding corresponding  periods  of  the  year,  1854,  were  made  up  last  night.  In  the  customs,  for  the  quarter,  there  is  a  falling  off  to  the  extent  of  £315,506,  as  compared  with  the  corresponding  quarter  of  1854,  but  on  the  year  there  is  an  increase,  of  £609,283.  The  excise  shows,  on  the  quarter,  the  small  increase  of  £53,154,  but  on  the  year  an  addition  of  £869,771.  The  net  increase  on  the  quarter  is  £321,475,  and  of  the  year  £133,396.  The  large  addition  made  to  the  revenue,  on  the  year  ending  yesterday,  as  compared  with  the  year  1854,  is  chiefly  owing  to  the  operation  of  the  double  income-tax.  Under  that  head  we  have,  for  the  year,  no  less  a  sum  than  £13,884,114,  against  £7,366,588,  for  the  year  ending  December  31st,  1854;  being  an  increase  of  no  less  than  '  1  £6,517,526.  •  A  letter  from  Havana,  arrived  per  the  America,  announces  the  arrival  at  that  port  of  H.  111.5.

A  variety  of  rumours  were  in  operation  to  produce  the  depression.
