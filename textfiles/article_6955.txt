Tae-pint's  northern  army  took  Ping-yang,  in  Shan-see,  on  the  12th  of  September,  left  it  a  day  or  two  after,  and  passed  eastward  of  Flung-tung,  in  the  direction  of  Pekin,  from  which  it  was  500  to  600  miles  distant.  Our  dates  from  Amoy  are  to  the  sth  inst.  Affairs  there  seemed  approaching  to  a  crisis  ;  the  fighting  had  harrassed  and  reduced  the  rebel  force,  which  was  in  want  of  provisions  and  money,  and  hemmed  in  by  the  imperial  troops  by  land,  and  a  strong  fleet  of  junks  to  oppose  them  on  the  waterside.  It  was  expected  the  city  would  be  retaken.  Her  Britannic  Majesty's  consul  had  removed  from  the  consulate  to  the  foreign  factories,  and  the  captain  of  Her  Majesty's  ship  Hermes  was  to  land  a  force  at  night  time.  At  Canton  there  is  nothing  new  to  mention;  the  city  remains  quiet,  and  the  protective  measures  are  efficient.

The  price  of  tea  is  maintained,  and  the  liner  quali-  ties  scarce.  At  Shanghai  shipments  of  tea  were  active;  in  imports  little  doing.  Exchange  on  England,  6s.  6d.  It  is  generally  understood  that  his  excellency  the  governor  Sir  George  Bonham's,  resignation  has  been  accepted  by  her  Majesty's  government,  His  successor  has  not  yet  been  nominated.  In  harbour,  her  Majesty's  ship  Winchester,  steamers  Rattler  and  Styx,  .and  ship  Hercules.  At  Whampoa,  her  Majesty's  brig  Lily,  the  United  States'  frigate  Macedonian,  steamers  Mississippi  and  Pozvhattan,  and  storeship  Supply.

Some  of  the  rebels  had  offered  possession  of  one  of  the  gates  of  Amoy  to  the  Mandarins,  for  $2,000.  The  insurgents  were  soon  expected  to  leave  the  city.
