"POST  OFFICE,  It  will  be  perceived,  by  the  report  of  the  Postmaster  -general,  that  the  gross  expenditure  of  the  department  for  the  last  fiscal  year  was  nine  millions  nine  hundred  and  sixty-eight  thousand  three  hundred  and  forty-two  dollars,  and  the  gross  receipts  seven  millions  three  hundred  and  forty-two  thousand  one  hundred  and  thirty-six  dollars,  making  an  excess  of  expendi expenditure  ture expenditure  over  receipts  of  two  millions  six  hundred  and  twenty-six  thousand  two  hundred  and  six  dollars;  and  that  the  cost  of  mail  transportation  during  that  year,  was  six  hundred  and  seventy-four  thousand  nine  hundred  and  fifty-two  dollars  greater  than  the  previous  year.  Much  of  the  heavy  expen expenditures,  ditures, expenditures,  to  which  the  treasury  is  thus  sul  jetted,  is  to  be  ascribed  to  the  large  quantity  of  printed  matter  conveyed  by  the  mails,  either  franked,  or  liable  to  no  postage  by  law,  or  to  very  low  rates  of  postage  compared  with  that  charged  on  letters;  and  to  the  great  cost  of  mail  service  on  railroads  and  by  ocean  steamers;  The  suggestions  of  the  Postmaster-general  on  the  subject,  deserve  the  consideration  of  Congress."
