A  few  of  the  best  samples  were  taken  at  a  &amp;cline  of  about  Is  per  quarter,  and  a  large  reduction  would  have  been  accepted  to  have  cleared  the  rest,  but  it  rempined  unsold  to  a  late  hour.  Foreign  wheat  was  neglected,  and  as  holders  do  not  care  to  pre,s  sales,  prices  remain  una'tered.  Barley  is  Is  to  2s  per  qr.,  beans  and  grey  peas  2s  per  qr.,  white  peas  4s  per  qr.  cheaper.  Oats  are  a  very  dull  sale,  at  rather  lower  prices.
