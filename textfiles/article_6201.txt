"MELBOURNE  GOLD  CIRCULAR.  The  price  of  gold  declined  on  the  closing  of  purchases  yesterday  for  the  Victoria.  It  is  now  765.  6d.  To-day,  however,  there  arose  a  brisk  demand  for  shipment  to  the  East  by  the  Shanghai,  which  could  not  be  supplied,  the  market  having  been  completely  cleared  for  the  Victoria.  The  news  from  Bendigo  is,  that  things  are  going  on  well,  ant  Beneral  satisfaction  is  felt  at  the  40s.  license-fee.  At  the  tioulout.  a  rush  had  taken  place  to  a  gully  four  miles  from  tha  principal  workings,  but  had  not  turned  out  so  rich  as  had  been  reported.  At  WTvor  very  little  was  doing,  the  Ovens  attracting  great  numbers,  both  from  that  field  and  the  Goulburn.  From  Ballarat's  jewellers'  shops  the  amount  of  gold  was  still  great,  many  diggers  realising  handsomely,  while  other  unfortunates  were  getting  none.  Digging,  or,  more  properly,  mining,  at  this  field  now  is  a  matter  of  serious  undertaking,  and  requires  a  considerable  amount  of  means  to  ensure  anything  like  success.  Some  rties  have  been  at  an  outlay  of  6001.  before  coining  to  the  bottom;  but  when  onee  there,  the.  yit.hl  has  richly  conm_  pensated  fps  t  h STYLE=superscript  i,llloA  - STYLE=superscript  of  the  amount  of  gold  brought  to  Melbourne  and  Geelong  by  escorts,  1853,  compared  .with  the  corresponding  quarter  of  1852_:  1852.  1853.

The  Victoria  steamer  has  taken  the  largest  amount  of  gold  since  that  shipped  by  the  Roxburgh  Castle  in  November,  1852.  £1,500  in  specie  has  arrived  this  week.

Labour  of  every  description  is  still  scarce,  in  consequence  of  the  great  numbers  of  working  men  who  have  left  town  within  the  last  two  or  three  weeks  for  the  diggings.  Female  servants  are  much  wanted,  and  agricultural  la labourers.  bourers. labourers.  Considerable  difficulty  is  found  in  procuring  sea seamen,  men, seamen,  either  for  the  run  home  or  short  voyages."
