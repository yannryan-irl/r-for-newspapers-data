"DOCK  COMMITTEE.—YEsTEnDAY.  The  usual  weekly  meeting  of  the  dock  committee  was  held  yesterday,  Mr.  CHARLES  TURNER,  in  the  chair.  The  other  members  present  were—Messrs.  Robinson,  Rankin,  Brocklebank,  Giegson,  Chaloner,  Steele,  Gladstone,  Barber,  Malcolinson,  Rounthwaite,  Lockett,  Smith,  Tobin,  Little Littledale,  dale, Littledale,  and  Evans.  The  sub-committee  recommended  that  the  tender  of  Messrs.  Wm.  M'Cormick  and  Co.,  for  work  at  Wapping,  be  accepted.  The  master  porters'  committee  recommended  that  the  sa salary  lary salary  of  Mr.  Hugh  D.  Clarke,  a  superintendent  of  the  weights  and  scales  upon  the  dock  quays,  be  raised  from  £7B  to  £lOO  a  year.  •  The  recommendation  was  agreed  to.  THE  PROPOSED  NEW  LANDING  STAGE.  The  CHAIRMAN  read  a  resolution  adopted  by  the  finance  committee  last  Friday,  in  regard  to  the  resolution  of  the  dock  trustees,  adopted  at  the  last  meeting,  with  reference  to  to  the  land  in  Prince's  dock,  required  by  the  corporation  for  the  purpose  of  building  the  proposed  new  landing  stage.  The  resolution  of  the  finance  committee  was  to  the  effect  that,  inasmuch  as  the  landing  stage  was  proposed  to  be  con constructed  structed constructed  azd  maintained  at  the  sole  expense  of  the  corpora corporation  tion corporation  for  the  advantage  of  the  port,  by  affording  additional  accommodation  for  channel  and  other  steamers,  the  commit committee  tee committee  were  of  opinion  that  the  land  necessary  should  be  given  by  the  dock  trust  without  payment,  but  the  committee  being  strongly  impressed  with  the  great  benefit  which  would  accrue  to  the  port  from  the  additional  accommodation,  would  nevertheless  recommend  the  council,  rather  than  the  advantages  should  be  lost,  to  consent  to  a  money  payment  being  made  by  the  cor*iration  in  respect  to  one-half  of  the  additional  land  required,  as  an  exchange  of  land  between  the  two  bodies  upon  equitable  terms  for  the  half  referred  to,  the  corporation  not,  however,  being  limited  to  part  with  that  portion  of  land  on  the  west  side  of  St.  George's  dock.  The  chairman  said  as  he  understood  that  the  corporation  agreed  to  pay  for  half  the  land,  or  to  give  land  in  exchange,  leaving  it  optional  whether  they  would  give  the  land  at  the  west  side  of  George's  dock  or  not.  Mr.  BARBER  said  another  construction  might  be  put  upon  it.  The  words  were  one  half  of  the  additional  That  might  have  reference  to  half  the  additional  portion  which  the  dock  committee  suggested.  The  CHAIRMAN  I  think  the  word  applies  to  the  whole  of  the  land  beyond  what  at  present  exists.  They  take  the  part  which  at  present  exists,  and  the  whole  of  the  land  which  is  proposed  to  be  given,  by  throwing  back  the  wall,  they  call  the  additional  land.  _  .  Mr.  ROBINSON  asked  if  they  were  not  placed  in  a  different  position  since  the  letter  of  Mr.  M'lver,  which  stated  that  foreign  steamers  would  not  avail  themselves  of  the  proposed  landing-  accommodation.  The  accommodation  would,  it  appeared,  be  only  availed  of  by  channel  steamers.  Now,  it  was  certain  that  cattle  could  not  be  tolerated  to  land  on  the  Prince's  pier,  and  he  did  not  see  why  they  should  make  these  arrangements  when  the  channel  steamers  might  be  accommodated  elsewhere.  It  seemed  to  him  that  these  steamers  would  always  go  into  a  dock  where  they  could  discharge.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  You  cannot  alter  your  prospectus.  You  have  made  a  proposal  to  the  corporation,  and  you  cannot  alter  it.  Mr.  BARBER  thought  it  would  be  very  injudicious  to  throw  away  the  advantage  which  the  dock  estate  now  pos possessed.  sessed. possessed.  The  corporation  admitted  that  they  must  have  the  .land,  and  it  could  only  be  got  from  this  estate.  Now,  the  dock  estate  did  not  want  any  land  but  that  pointed  out  in  their  resolution,  and  he  thought  it  would  be  well  that  they  should  adhere  to  that  resolution  very  pertinaciously.  Mr.  BROCKLEBANK  said  there  was  another  portion  of  land,  called  the.  Corporation  dock,  which  it  might  be  very  ad advisable  visable advisable  that  the  dock  estate  should  get  into  their  poi  -  session.  Mr.  GLADSTONE  :  Have  you  seen  the  circular,  Mr.  Chair Chairman,  man, Chairman,  to  which  Mr.  Robinson  adverted  ?  The  CHAIRMAN  :  I  have  seen  the  letter  in  the  newspapers,  and  it  is  to  the  same  effect  that  the  ocean  steamers,  Mr.  M'lver  thinks,  will  not  use  the  landing  stage  ;  but  at  the  same  time  he  stated  it  as  his  opinion  that  the  whole  of  the  pro proposed  posed proposed  space  will  not  be  sufficient  for  the  purposes  of  the  other  steamers.  Mr.  EVANS  :  We  should  never  forget  that  we  got  nothing  for  the  other  landing  stage.  .  Mr.  TOBIN  :  It  was  not  the  corporation  estate  which  made  the  dock  estate  pay  for  that  at  all.  It  was  by  other  parties.  Mr.  EVANS  :  But  the  corporation  looked  on.  Mr.  BROCKLEBANIC  was  in  favour  of  the  estate  getting  an  equivalent  from  the  corporation  in  land.  The  CHAIRMAN  .their  agreement  will  be  to  give  you  land.  Mr.  MALCOLMSON  thought  the  terms  of  the  corporation  proposition  very  indefinite.  .  The  CHAIRMAN  :  Of  course  if  they  give  us  land  in  ex ex°hag°  °hag° ex°hag°  we  must  get  it  in  what  situation  we  choose  to  take,  or  they  must  give  us  money.  Mr.  GLADSTONE  thought  the  land  upon  the  west  side  of  the  Prince's  dock,  as  valuable  as  that  upon  the  west  side  of  the  George's  dock,  and  therefore  it  should  be  exchanged  yard  for  yard.  .  The  Cff.h.nuitsra  ;  That,  I  should-  think.  will  be  a  question  for  the  valuator.  Mr  Small  moved  that  the  proposition  or  the  corporation  be  agreed  to.  Mr.  ROUNTinAr  AITE  seconded  the  motion.  Mr.  BARBER  moved  an  amendment  that  the  equivalent  be  in  land  and  not  in  money,  and  that  the  land  be  either  upon  the  west  side  of  George's  dock,  upon  the  corporation  dock,  at  the  west  side  of  the  Queen's  dock.  Mr.  GLADErroxE  thought  those  who  succeeded  them  would  have  reason  to  find  fault  with  them  if  they  did  not  distinctly  designate  the  land  which  they  would  take  in  exchange.  (Hear.)  They  were  called  upon  to  part  with  very  valuable  land,  and  as  a  plain,  straightforward  proceeding,  he  should  like  to  know  what  land  they  were  to  get  in  return.  That  was  a  plain  matter  of  calculation  which  he  wished  to  un understand.  derstand. understand.  Mr.  EVANS  seconded  Mr.  Barber's  amendment.  The  amendment  was  then  put,  when  there  appeared  For  :  Messrs.  Gladstone,  Brocklebank,  Maleolmson,  E  tans,  Barber,  Chaloner,  and  Lockett.  Against  :  Messrs.  Gregson,  Littledale,  Robinson,  Tobin,  Rounthwaite,  Steel,  Smith,  Rankin  and  the  Chairman.  The  amendment  was  therefore  declared  lost  by  a  majority  of  9  to  7.  Mr.  SMITH'S  motion  was  then  put  and  carried.  The  SOLICITOR  read  a  report  in  reference  to  a  letter  from  Messrs.  M'Lean,  suggesting  that  some  means  should  be  taken  to  prevent  fraud  in  the  paying  of  dock  dues,  by  the  party  who  paid  the  money  .  receiving  a  stamped  receipt  to  return  to  the  merchant,  or  in  some  other  way.  The  solicitor  stated  that  the  dock  trustees  were  bound  to  give  receipts  if  required  for  all  money  paid  over  405.,  the  party  who  paid  the  money  to  produce  a  stamped  paper  and  deduct  the  id.  from  thepayment.  He  referred  to  the  old  plan  ofissuing  a  duplicate  receipt  which  might  be  handed  back  to  the  party  paying  after  being  stamped  by  the  dock  trustees.  This  plan  had  been  found  to  involve  considerable  trouble  and  delay  and  was  not  always  effectual.  He  suggested  that  a  duplicate  dock  bill  should  be  produced  with  the  sum  to  be  paid  written  in  words  at  full  length.  It  was  agreed  after  some  conversation  that  the  finance  committee  should  receive  directions  to  renew  the  old  prac practice  tice practice  of  stamping  the  duplicate  bills.  An  application  for  increase  of  salary  froM  Mr.  Jackson,  one  of  the  book-keepers  in  the  treasurer's  department,  was  referred  back  to  the  finance  committee.  Mr.  LITTLEnALE  drew  attention  to  tho  great  importancs  of  ascertaining  with  what  body  the  power  lay  of  regulating  the  mooring  of  vessels  in  the  river.  This  was  of  great  im importance  portance importance  especially  in  such  foggy  weather  as  the  present.  That  morning  he  had  heard  that  one  of  the  Woodside  boats,  with  300  persons  on  board,  struck  across  an  American  vessel  moored  in  the  river,  and  endangered,  of  course,  so  many  lives.  It  would  be  very  wise  of  that  trust  to  take  some  steps  by  which  they  might  have  the  power  vested  in  some  one  of  regulating  the  mooring  of  vessels.  He  would  suggest  that  the  chairman  should  mention  it  to  the  finance  com committee.  mittee. committee.  The  CHAIRUAN  I  always  understood  that  that  the  legal  power  was  in  the  hands  of  the  water-bailiff.  The  Soucrron  said  there  was  really  no  adequate  power  in  the  hands  of  any  party.  The  CuirnmAN  undertook  to  make  a  representation  of  the  matter.  This  closed  the  general  business.  The  Cynet,  Blyth  brig  was  wrecked  in  the  Tyne  on  Tues Tuesday.  day. Tuesday.  The  supply  was  injured,  and  is  in  the  dock.  The  rest  of  the  coal  flat  got  clear.  _  _  _  CUSTOMS  PR  MOTIONS.—Mr.  Robert  Pope,  tide-surveyor,  of  Grimsby,  has  been  promoted  to  the  same  office,  at  the  higher  classed  port  of  Sunderland  ;  and  Mr.  Christopher  M'Cain,  acting  tide-surveyor  at  Sunderland,  has  been  pro promoted  moted promoted  to  the  office  of  established  tide-surveyor  at  Grimsby.  There  are  now  three  established  tide-surveyors  at  Sunder Sunderland  land Sunderland  ;  and  se  are  glad  to  say  that,  from  the  increased  amount  of  business  at  the  port,  they  are  all  kept  actively  employed.  PLEDGES  OP  EGYPTIAN  CIVILISATION.—A  letter  from  Munich,  of  the  19th  says  Four  young  Egyptians  have  just  taken  out  their  den  Tee  of  doctor  in  physic  at  this  uni university.  versity. university.
