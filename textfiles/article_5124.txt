"COUNTY  CO  URT.-YESTERDAY.  LYONS  v.  LYNN.—Mr.'llimE,  who  appeared  for  the  plain plaintiff,  tiff, plaintiff,  a  steward  residing  at  Kirkdale,  said  he  claimed  from  the  defendant,  as  secretary  to  the  Liverpool  Economic  Friendly  Burial  Society,  the  sum  of  £4  10s.,  as  payment  ou  the  death  of  a  woman  named  Mary  Keely,  who  died  in  1853,  at  burrow,  in  the  county  of  Carlow,  Ireland.  The  defen defendant  dant defendant  had  certified  in  writing  that  the  money  was  due,  and  that  it  would  be  paid  as  soon  as  the  proper  certificates  had  been  received  from  the  clergymen  of  the  parish  in  which  the  deceased  had  died.  The  clergyman  was  accordingly  communicated  with,  and  in  his  reply  he  stated  that  he  had  forwarded,  on  application,  the  usual  certificates  to  •  the  de defendant.  fendant. defendant.  The  defence  set  up  was  that  by  the  rules  of  the  society  all  disputes  should  be  settled  by  arbitration,  and  that  they  required—though  not  a  rule  of  the  society—that  in  every  case  an  extract  should  be  furnished  from  the  books  of  the  registrar  of  deaths.  His  HONOR  observed  that  they  had  no  right  to  require  anything  except  what  their  rules  authorised.  If  these  rules  were  defective  they  could  have  been  altered,  but  at  present  the  members  were  only  bound  to  comply  with  those  rules.  The  case  was  adjourned  to  Monday,  in  order  that  the  books  of  the  society  might  be  produced,  and  that  it  might  be  seen  whether  or  not  the  society  had  appointed  arbitrators  for  the  settlement  of  disputes.  ISAAC  v.  HAY.—The  plaintiff,  for  whom  Mr.  GROCOTT  ap appeared  peared appeared  is  Mr.  John  R.  Isaac,  62,  Castle-street,  engraver,  and  the  defendant  is  Mr.  John  Hay,  1,  Cable-street,  architect  ;  and  the  action  was  brought  to  recover  ss.  balance  of  an  account  under  the  following  cir circumstances  cumstances circumstances  :  The  plaintiff  sold  to  the  defendant  on  the  10th  October  a  number  of  architectural  books  for  £7  ss.  They  were  sent  to  his  house  on  the  29th  October,  but  when  payment  was  demanded,  he  alleged  that  he  had  purchased  them  for  £7.  The  plaintiff  then  sent  his  servant  with  the  receipt,  and  directed  him  to  get  either  the  money  or  the  books.  The  defendant,  however,  would  not  return  the  books,  and  getting  the  receipt  for  the  purpose  of  looking  at  it,  he  retained  it  in  his  possession,  and  left  the  messenger  no  alternative  but  to  take  the  £7,  which  were  t  en  d  ere  d  him.  The  defendant  did  not  appear  himself,  and  the  only  defence  set  up  was  the  possession  of  the  receipt,  which  was  produced  by  a  gentlemen  who  appeared  on  his  behalf.  _  _  _  His  - STYLE=superscript  HoNon  observed  hat  the  defendant  had  no  right  to  retain  the  books  unless  on  payment  of  the  sum  invoiced  to  him.  He  was  sorry  that  the  case  should  have  been  brought  into  court,  and  he  should  give  a  verdict  for  the  plaintiff,  with  costs.  CATCHING  A  TARTAR.  —M'CONVILLE  v.  DORAN.—The  plaintiff  is  a  clockmaker,  residing  at  25,  Carpenter's  .row,  and  the  defendant  is  a  carter,  living  at  60,  Pitt-street;  and  the  action  was  brought  to  recover  15s.  2d.,  for  goods  sold  and  delivered.  The  defendant  treated  the  claim  very  cavalierly,  and  when  it  was  established  and  a  verdict  given  against  him,  he  indignantly  left  the  box,  and  exclaimed,  I  will  go  to  jail,  and  pay  it  there.  His  HONOR  :  Do  you  wish  to  go  to  jail  now  ?  DORAN  :  Yes,  at  once.  His  HONOR  :  - STYLE=superscript  Then  let  him  be  locked  up.  [Doran  was  then  taken  into  custody,  and  appeared  not  a  little  surprised  at  being  so  taken  at  his  word.  Previous,  however,  to  the  rising  of  the  court,  Doran,  considerably  calmed  down,  came  into  court  and  apologised  for  the  ex expressions  pressions expressions  he  had  been  guilty  of.]  His  HoNoit;  after  receiving  the  apology,  said  :  I  wish  you  had  not  been  so  foolish  as  to  so  misconduct  yourself.  You  are  at  liberty  . STYLE=superscript  now,  and  it  does  not  give  you  greater  pleasure  to  go,  than  it  does  me  to  discharge  you.  BRYCE  ALLAN  AND  ANOTHER  V.  DAY  AND  CO.—MT.  Almond  appeared  for  the  plaintiffs,  Messrs.  Allan  and  Gilles Gillespie  pie Gillespie  ;  and  Mr.  Edwards,  for  the  defendants,  Messrs.  Day  and  Co.,  Prince's-buildings,  North  John-street.  It  appeared  that  in  the  month  of  last  September,  the  plaintiffs  were  assignees  of  a  vessel  called  the  Universe,  which  was  then  dis discharginc,  charginc, discharginc,  a  cargo  of  corn  in  the  Albert  dock.  The  defend defendant  ant defendant  had  the  discharging  of  a  part  of  the  cargo,  and  in  order  to  facilitate  their  doing  so,  the  plaintiffs  sent  down  to  the  Albert  dock  warehouses,  500  sacks,  to  be  used  by  the  de defendants  fendants defendants  as  3ccasion  might  require.  The  sacks  were  used  on  several  occasions,  but  when  returned,  it  was  alleged  they  were  short  by  54  ;  and  the  present  action  was  accordingly  brought  to  recover  £4  2s.  Bd.,  the  estimated  value.  On  the  part  of  the  defendants,  it  was  admitted  that  they  had  used  196  of  the  sacks  on  one  occasion  '  •  but  that  they  had  returned  and  paid  for  them.  They  had  employed  the  Messrs.  Gardner  and  Co.  to  discharge  the  cargo  for  them,  and  though  it  appeared  upon  the  evidence  that  some  sacks  had,  subsequently  to  the  first  transaction,  been  delivered  from  the  Albert  dock  warehouse,  it  did  not  appear  that  they  were  delivered  on  the  order  of  the  defendants,  or  applied  to  their  use.  His  HONOR  held  that  the  defendants  were  not  liable  ;  but  intimated  that  it  was  a  question  whether  the  claim  could  not  be  established  against  the'  parties  at  the  Albert  dock  ware warehouse  house warehouse  or  the  Messrs.  Gardner  and  Co.  Tho  plaintiffs  were  accordingly  non-suited.  COURT  OF  BANKRUPTCY.  lr  -  _ESTERDAX.  BEFORE  MR.  COMMISSIONER  PERRY.  -  .  IN  RE  WILLIAM  RAINFORD.-111  this  case  the  bankrupt,  an  upholsterer  and  cabinet-maker,  in  Renshaw-street,  came  up  for  his  certificate.  - STYLE=superscript  Mr.  DODGE,  on  behalf  of  the  assignees,  expressed  his  entire  approval  of  the  bankrupt's  conduct  before  and  since  his  bankruptcy,  and  trusted  that  his  Honor  would  think  fit  to  award  him  an  immediate  certificate  of  the  first  class.  The  assignees  had  not  lost  confidence  in  Mr.  Rainford,  but  on  the  contrary,  were  affording  him  their  assistance  in  carrying  on  his  business,  which  he  had  recently  re-commenced.  The  COMMISSIONER  said  he  had  very  great  satisfaction  in  assenting  to  the  wishes  of  the  assignees  ;  that  the  bankrupt  left  the  court  without  the  slightest  stain  upon  his  reputa reputation,  tion, reputation,  and  he  trusted  that  success  might  attend  him  in  his  future  exertions.  The  certificate  was  accordingly  granted.  SAILING  OF  THE  ARCTIC.—The  United  States  mail  steam steamship  ship steamship  Arctic,  sailed  yesterday  from  the  Mersey  for  New  York,  with  the  usual  mails,  a  very  large  carso,  and  93  passengers.  SHIP  LAUNCH.—A  fine  ship,  named  the  Margaret  Diane,  intended  for  the  Brazilian  trade,  was  yesterday  launched  from  the  building-yard  of  Messrs.  Rennie,  Johnson,  and  Rennie,  Brunswick  dock.  The  Margaret  Deane  is  owned  by  a  company  in  Manchester,  and  is  to  be  commanded  by  Captain  Green.  THE  TNETOTALLERS  OF  LIVERPOOL  AND  THE  PRESTON  TURN-OUTS.—Last  night  a  public  meeting  was  convened  at  the  lodge  room,  Circus-street,  at  which  two  advocates  from  Preston  attended,  on  behalf  of  the  teetotallers  of  that  town.  There  was  but  a  very  small  attendance.  The  chair  was  taken  by  Mr.  John  Carter,  who,  in  stating  the  objects  of  the  meeting,  said  the  subject,  or  rather  object,  for  which  they  were  collected  together  that  evening,  was  one  which  he,  as  chairman,  had  not  taken  an  active  part,  but  having  been  invited  to  take  the  chair,  he  bad  had  sufficient  opportunities  of  reading  and  contemplating  on  the  conduct  of  the  working  classes,  and  of  the  masters  and  employers  of  the  town  of  Preston.  Having  read  on  this  subject,  and  understanding  it  for  himself,  he  felt  most  deeply—most  acutely  for  the  condi condition  tion condition  of  those  men  who  had  been  so  long  deprived  of  that  remuneration  for  their  labour  which  they  were  led  to  expect  would  be  returned  to  them  •  the  masters  of  that  district  were  blessed  with  prosperity.  in  the  year  1847,  if  he  (the  chair chairman)  man) chairman)  was  not  mistaken,  the  masters  of  that  district  reduced  the  wages  of  the  operatives  seven  per  cent.  To  this  reduc reduction  tion reduction  the  operatives  consented,  with  the  understanding  that  when  the  trade  revived,  and  times  became  better  the  wages  would  be  advanced  again.  That  time  of  prosperity  had  arrived,  the  mills  had  been  well  occupied,  but  up  to  the  pre present  sent present  moment  the  masters  had  not  taken  one  single  step  to  return  to  the  poor  operatives  the  10  per  cent.,  although  those  masters  had  accumulated  large  fortunes—although  they  had  added  mill  to  mill,  and  he  might  say  estate  to  estate—yet  they  still  persisted  in  withholding  from  the  eratives  their  just  rights.  The  working  people  of  that  district  had  ap appealed  pealed appealed  to  those  masters,  but  the  masters  had  refused  to  lis listen  ten listen  to  them,  and  the  result  was,  that  between  20,000  and  30,000  of  the  industrious  artisans,  were  thrown  out  of  em employment—not  ployment—not employment—not  because  the  masters  could  not  afford  to  give  it,  but  because  they  had  waxed  fat  and  stuck  with  death deathlike  like deathlike  tenacity  to  the  profits.  No,  instead  sympathising  with  the  poor  operatives,  they  had  shut  up  their  mills,  and  said  by  their  actions,  will  not  redeem  our  promise—we  will  not  consent  to  an  advance—but  we  will  shut  up  our  mills,  and  compel  you  tu  our  terms,  or  we  will  starve  you  to  It  was  not  the  wish  of  the  operatives  to  deprive  the  masters  of  a  just  return  for  the  capital  they  had  invested,  all  they  wanted  was  a  proper  remuneration  for  their  labour,  in  order  that  they  might  feed  and  clothe  their  families,  and  properly  educate  their  children.  They  had  met  together  that  evening  to  appeal  to  the  public  of  Liverpool  for  sym sympathy,  pathy, sympathy,  and  also  to  contribute  their  mite  towards  the  sup support  port support  of  the  poor  teetotallers  of  Preston—men  who  richly  de deserved  served deserved  the  sympathy  of  all.  The  meeting,  he  regretted,  was  'email  as  to  numbers,  but  that,  he  was  proud  to  say,  was  no  criterion  to  judge  by,  as  to  how  the  people  of  Liverpool  sym sympathised  pathised sympathised  with  the  disheartened—for  he  was  informed  that  the  deputation  had  been  most  warmly  met,  and  contribu contributions  tions contributions  had  been  given  by  private  circles.  Unfortunately  the  working  classes  were  viewed  in  a  different  light  to  those  who  moved  in  higher  circles,  and  of  all  labour  mental  labour  was  paid  the  best.  He  would  instance  the  town  of  Liverpool.'  Here  the  comparison  would  appear  most  lamentable.  For  instance,  they  had  it  in  evidence,  that  the  salaries  of  the  officials  of  the  corporation  had  been  much  increased,  but  the  increase  had  not  been  made  in  the  salaries  of  those  who  toiled  and  did  the  labour,  but  to  those  who  did  little  and  were  well  paid  before  the  increase  took  place.  It  was  given  to  men  who  were  well  paid  before.  One  man,  who  was  receiving  £2,000  per  year,  could  not  maintain  his  family  respectably  with  that  amount,  and  they  gave  him  £2,500.  Another  could  not  live,  considering  the  dear  price  of  provisions,  on  £5OO  per  year,  so  the  corporation  made  it  £6OO  ;  but  when  the  poor  men,  who  had  only  20s.  per  week,  asked  to  be  advanced  25.,  only  2s  ,  to  enable  them  to  get  the  common  necessaries  of  life,  no  heel  was  paid  to  their  appeal,  but  it  was  said,  20s.  per  week  is  quite  sufficient  for  you.  That  showed  that  the  higher  classes  looked  to  themselves,  and  the  sphere  in  which  they  moved,  and  it  was  just  the  same  with  regard  to  the  em employers  ployers employers  of  Preston.  He  concluded  by  saying,  they  were  called  upon,  as  teetotallers,  to  give  their  assistance  to  a  few  of  their  teetotal  brethren  in  Preston,  who,  through  the  conduct  of  the  masters,  were  in  a  most  deplorable  condition.  Several  speakers  afterwards  addressed  the  meeting,  detailing  the  distress  that  existed  in  Liverpool,  earnestly  asking  for  assistance,  after  which  the  meeting  separated.

RUMOURED  INSURREC INSURRECTION  TION INSURRECTION  IN  PORTUGAL.  The  Madrid  correspondent  of  the  Chronicle,  writing  on  the  24th,  says,  have  disastrous  news  from  Portugal.  A  letter  from  Orense,  Galicia,  received  this  morning,  says  that  a  rising  has  taken  place  at  Oporto  against  the  regency  of  the  King-Consort  ;  and  the  Clamor  Publico  has  a  letter  from  Badajoz,  dated  the  21st  inst.,  which  states  that  the  13th  regiment  of  infantry  has  risen  in  insurrection,  in  the  direction  of  the  Douro,  and  proclaimed  Don  Miguel;  and  that  Miguelites  of  note  had  already  brought  many  recruits  to  their  ranks.  is  an  unfortunate  fact  that  (however  un unjustly)  justly) unjustly)  the  King-Consort  has  always  been  unpopular  in  Portugal,  and  perhaps  the  best  thing  that  could  now  be  done  would  be  for  the  Portuguese  Cortes  to  proclaim  the  Young  Prince  (Don  Pedro  V.)  of  age  ;  he  is  upwards  of  16,  and  has  received  an  excellent  education,  and,  above  all,  is  Portuguese,  which,  like  charity,  covers  a  multitude  of  sins  in  that  country,  which  is  particularly  averse  to  being  governed  by  foreigners  ;  in  which  antipathy,  would  probably  consist  a  great  part  of  Don  Miguel's  success,  if  an  insurrection  has  already  commenced  in  his  P3_TB00013 •  _"
