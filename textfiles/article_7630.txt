Articles  of  the  best  manufacture  have  been  marked  at  prices  so  low,  that  those  of  the  most  inferior  description  could  not  be  purchased  at  the  same  rate,  even  by  wholesale.

H.  takes  the  opportunity  of  stating,  that  those  Persons  wh(  may  hitherto  have  bean  deterred  from  visiting  his  Establishment,  by  its  great  extent  and  the  valuable  Collection  of  Goods,  are  not  aware  that,  by  overcoming  this  impression,  (in  reality  a  prejudice,)  the  result  would  be  most  advantageous  to  them,  as  they  would  find  that  they  can  purchase  Articles  of  a  bttter  quality,  and  at  Lower  Prices,  than  at  any  other  Establishment.  He  considers  it  almost  superfluous  to  acid,  that,  whether  they  make  Purchases  or  other otherwise,  wise, otherwise,  they  will,  in  every  case,  be  received  with  politeness  and  atten attention.  tion. attention.
