"WAKEFIELD  CORN  MARKET:-YESTERDAY  There  was  a  good  arrival  of  Wheat,  which  met  a  steady  sale,  at  about  last  weeks  rates  for  both  old  and  new.  Barley  was  in  better  supply;  all  except  choice  descriptions  reached  in  value.  Oats  were  steady.  Beans  scarce  and  rather  dearer;  dry  new  were  sold  at  48s.  per  quarter.  All  other  articles  as  before."
