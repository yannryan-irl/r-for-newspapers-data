"FRANCE  Some  mischance,  as  yet  unaccountable,  has  deprived  us  of  the  usual  letter  from,  our  Parisian  correspondent.  In  its  absence  we  abstain  from  adopting  the  news  promulgated  in  that  peculiar  political  hemisphere.  This,  however,  we  may  say  from  the  intelligence  which  has  reached  us  from  other  sources  from.that  quarter,  that  nothing  is  to  be  added  to  the  news  already  published  in  our  columns  with  reference  to  the  pending  negoeiationg  on  the  Austrian  proposals."
