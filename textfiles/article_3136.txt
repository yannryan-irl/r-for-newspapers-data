"WEST  INDIES.  We  have  received  files  of  the  West  Indian,  Bar Barbadoes,  badoes, Barbadoes,  to  Sept.  23.  The  month  of  August  has  been  remarkably  favourable  for  the  planter.  There  has  been  a  plentiful  supply  of  rain,  which,  with  hot  suns,  has  much  improved  the  appearance  of  the  canes.  Seldom  has  this  critical  month  been  more  favourable.  The  consequence  is,  the  almost  general  expectation  of  a  large  crop  next  year,  On  account  of  the  rains,  foreign  manures  have  been  in  demand,  and  there  is  a  scarcity,  particularly  of  guano.  The  canes  are  not  so  forward  on  the  Cliff,  and  in  the  central  parts  of  the  Island,  as  they  are  about  Bridgetown,  and  in  the  out  parishes  of  Christ  Church  and  St,  Philip,  and  to  leeward,  But  this  is,  in  a  great  measure,  to  be  attributed  to  the  late  finishing  of  the  crops  on  the  hills,  and  the  ratoons  not  having  time  yet  to  show  themselves.  The  planters  are  busy  preparing  the  fields  for  next  year's  crop  ;  and  in  some  places  we  have  observed,  are  by  no  means  forward  in  their  preparations.  Few  eddoes,  and  fewer  yams,  have  been  planted  ;  and  they  are  digging  potatoes,  which  are  not  so  plentiful  as  was  expected."
