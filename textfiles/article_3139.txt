"NEW  YORK  MARKF4TS.-OCT.  24  MONEY  AND  SToCKS.—The  restoration  of  comparative  quiet  in  Stock  and  Money  matters  noticed  on  Saturday,  was  followed  to-day  by  a  gratifying  measure  of  ease  among  the  brokers,  and  some  dullness  in  the  operations  in  paper.  Foreign  bills  were  also  easier  in  rates,  with  a  fair  amount  of  business  for  the  Boston  steamer,  at  1091  to  109  k  on  London.

THE  COTTON  TRADE.  NEW  YORK,  TUESDAY,  Oct.  25th,  1853  The  Cotton  Brokers  of  this  city  have  formed  an  associa association  tion association  to  be  known  as  the  New  York  Cotton  Brokers'  They  have  adopted  a  standard  of  classifica classification,  tion, classification,  a  method  of  reporting  daily,  the  sales,  and  of  deter determining,  mining, determining,  once  a  week,  the  current  value  of  the  various  qualities  of  cotton.  They  are  also  prepared  to  decide  any  matter  in  dispute,  appertaining  to  the  trade,  submitted  to  them  for  arbitration.  It  is  believed  this  will  give  greater  uniformity  to  the  system  of  reporting,  and  be  more  satis satisfactory  factory satisfactory  to  those  engaged  in  the  cotton  business,  than  the  system  hitherto  practiced,  of  each  broker  quoting  for  himself  _  _  _  .  _  .Y  Since  my  circular  of  the  19th  inst.,  we  are  in  receipt  of  Liverpool  advices  per  Asia  to  Bth  October.  That  market  continued  depressed,  and  sales,  particularly  of  the  lower  grades,  were  being  made  at  very  irregular  rates.  Political  matters  were  still  unsettled  and  uncertain.  Further  stop stoppages  pages stoppages  of  mills  reported,  and  more  expected.  Money  in  demand,  and  a  disposition  to  curtail  operations  in  every  branch  of  business,  very  general.  The  business  in  this  market  induced  by  the  lower  scale  of  prices  ruling,  has  been,  within  the  past  few  days,  somewhat  increased,  and  the  sales  since  the  18th  inst.,  to  last  evening,  have  amounted  to  5,000  bales,  chiefly  for  export  and  home  consumption,  and  prices  have  further  declined;,  to  is  per  lb.
