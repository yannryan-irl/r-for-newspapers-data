O  n  account  of  the  Import(  )  91_  :3  THE  attempts  which  have  been  made,  and  which  are  promised,  of  an  unjustifiable  rivalry  to  the  port  of  Liverpool,  as  an  Ocean  Steam  Packet  Station,  re require  quire require  the  immediate  and  earnest  attention  of  the  commercial  community.  Southampton  has  long  been  the  favourite  of  a  certain  party,  who  apprehend  more  enlightened,  and  consequently  more  formidable,  opposition  from  our  Borough  and  the  North,  than  from  any  other  portion  of  the  United  Kingdom.  But  where  are  Southampton's  commercial  advantages?  Where  are  •  her  trade  facilities,  her  postal  requirements,  compared  with  the  port  of  the  slavery  abolitionist  and  free-trader  of  the  North  ?  The  'establishment  of  ocean  steam  communication  E.,  has  hitherto  been  accomplished  at  the  public  expense,  while  the  old  postal  policy  of  the  country  has  been  totally  aban abandoned,  doned, abandoned,  and  private  ,interests  destroyed,  without  any  corresponding  advantage  being  secured  to  the  public..  •  To  sustain  the  Southampton  and  West  Indian  steam-ship  line,  the  public  contribute  to  the  tune  of  about  XlOO,OOO  per  annum  ;  and  there  is  scarcely  a  public  undertaking  of  the  kind,  Avhich  has  given  less  general  satisfaction,  and  which  has  proved  more  disastrous  to  the  Company  itself.  Their  losses  from  shipwreck  and  want  of  punctuality  are  proverbial,  and  have  left  but  the  lowest  profits  in  the  -shape  of  dividends  to  the  shareholders.  A  cursory  glance  at  facts  will  account  for  all  this,  and  something  more.  Public  Companies,  estab established  lished established  in  London,  are  generally  presided  over,  more  by  influential  men  of  fashion  than  of  busi business.  ness. business.  This  is  the  first  and  great  cardinal  mistake  for  both  the  shareholder  and  .  the  public  ;  and  in  the  Southampton  Companies  we  have  this  error  fully  exemplified.  ,The  extraordinary  selection  of  Southampton  as  a  Packet  Station,  is  another  and  most  prominent  feature  in  the  want  of  success.  Fancy  a  ship,  requiring  cargo  from  the  North  of  England  being  carried  away  as  far  South  as  pos possible  sible possible  to  load  !  Is  there  no  fallacy  here?  But  fancy  the  letters  of  the  Northern  traders  being  carried  away  to  London,  and  then  to  Southampton,  to  be  shipped  for  the  West  Indies,  the  Gulfs  of  Mexico"
