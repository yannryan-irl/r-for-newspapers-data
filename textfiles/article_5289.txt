"MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL.  LIVERPOOL,  FRIDAY  EVENING.  Considerable  anxiety  manifested  itself  in  the  London  Money  Market,  yesterday,  after  the  official  closing,  and  again  to=day,  as  to  the  heavy  amount  of  Austraian  bills  which  fall  due  to-morrow.  But  the  advices  from  Sydney  and  Melbourne,  via  Singapore,  which  reach  to  the  _  6th  Sept.,  soon  dispelled  the  gloom  that  seemed  at  one  time  to  forebode  a  crisis.  From  Ballarat,  Canadian  Gully,  and  other  districts,  the  yield  of  gold  reported  would,  in  other  ages,  be  considered  perfectly  fabulous  The  Geelong  Adver Advertiser  tiser Advertiser  states,  that  one  party  at  Prince  Regent's  Gully  washed  out  in  six  hours  901bs.  of  gold,  and  in  three  days  had  obtained  1,960  ounces  :  the  hole  was  expected  by  the  party  to  yield  at  least  10  to  12  cwt.  A  nugget,  weighing  114  ounces  10  dwts.,  had  been  found  in  this  Gully,  at  25  feet  depth.  The  yield  of  gold  for  the  week  ending  28th  August  had  been  unprecedented.  In  the  neighbourhood  of  the  Canadian  Gully,  such  a  quantity  of  the  metal  had  been  taken  out  that  we  feel  a  diffidence  in  quoting  it.  From  1401bs.  to  1501bs.  have  been  obtained  in  a  short  time  from  claims  in  this  quarter  ;  in  addi addition  tion addition  to  this,  the  vein  at  the  gravel  pits  has  been  recovered,  and  871bs.  weight  was  taken  from  one  bottom  without  driving.  The  legislative  council  of  Sydney  had  agreed  to  raise  100,0001,  on  debentures,  secured  on  the  territorial  revenue,  which  amount  was  to  be  expended  in  keeping  up  the  stream  of  immigration  to  the  colony  to  supply  the  great  want  of  labour.  The  wharves  were  crowded  with  goods,  the  rate  of  storage  extravagantly  high,  and  several  vessels  had  been  at  anchor  one  month  with  full  cargoes  on  board,  .without  any  attempt  being  made  to  discharge  them.  The  Lieutenant-Governor  of  Victoria  had  intimated  his  intention  to  submit  a  bill  to  the  council  for  abolishing  the  license  fee,  and  it  was  conjectured  that  a  gold  duty  would  take  its  place.  It  was  also  stated  that  the  governor  proposed  levying  a  duty  on  sugar.  With  these  ex extraordinary  traordinary extraordinary  advices  in  hand  we  may  expect  a  very  decided  reaction  in  the  Stock  and  Share  markets.  The  scarcity  of  gold  cannot  continue  to  be  a  disturbing  cause  for  any  length  of  time.  Consols  closed  944  to  95  for  money  and  account.  Three  and-a-quarter  per  cents.,  95i  to  958.  Reduced,  931.  Bank  Stock,  217  to  219.  Exchequer  Bills,  3s.  to  6.  prem.  The  Foreign  House  was  almost  deserted  to-day.  A  few  trifling  transactions  only  are  reported,  and  those  were  confined  to  a  limited  amount  of  Sar Sardinian,  dinian, Sardinian,  Dutch,  and  Russian  Stock.  The  Share  Market  was  much  agitated  to-day,  and  after  considerable  fluctuations  closed.
