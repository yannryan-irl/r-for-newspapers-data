"ITALY.  ROME,  Drc  14.—0  n  Sunday  evening,  a  brigadier  of  gendarmes  was  struck  dead  by  a  blow  in  the  throat,  evidently  from  the  dagger  of  a  powerful  and  practised  assassin.  He  was  dressed  in  plain  clothes  at  the  time,  and  had  been  supping  in  company  with  two  women,  well  known  to  artists  as  the  veteran  model  Menica  and  her  daughter,  at  an  csteria  in  the  Vicolo  Cacciabove.  He  got  up  from  the  table  about  seven  o'clock,  and  had  hardly  gone  a  few  steps,  to  wards  the  church  of  Santa  Maria  in  Via  Lata,  when  he  was  overtaken  by  an  individual,  who  tapped  him  on  the  shoulder.  He  at  once  turned  his  head,  and  received  his  mortal  blow  on  the  other  side,  the  position  of  his  neck  affording  a  secure  aim  to  the  assassin,  who  passed  on  at  once  and  dis disappeared  appeared disappeared  from  the  eyes  of  the  terrrified  fe females.  males. females.  A  picket  of  soldiers,  from  the  French  corps  de  garde,  on  the  Piazza  Colonna,  took  its  station  round  the  corpse,  until  a  party  of  Roman  sbirri  made  their  appearance,  anxious  to  see  which  of  their  companions  it  was  who  had  fallen—a  cry  of  Morelli,  soon  informed  the  bystanders  that  the  murdered  man  was  a  noted  sub-officer,  a  great  favourite  with  Colonel  Nardoni,  and  an  equal  object  of  detestation  with  the  people.  Everybody  connected  with  the  wine-shop,  and  several  persons  belonging  to  the  neighbourhood  who  were  there  at  the  time,  to  the  number  of  seventeen,  were  imme immediately  diately immediately  taken  off  to  prison,  but  it  is  the  general  opinion  that  the  real  delinquent  is  at  liberty,  as  the  skill  with  which  the  stab  was  inflicted,  dividing  the  carotid  artery,  and  the  preparatory  tap  on  the  shoulder  given  to  insure  the  proper  position,  call  to  mind  the  similar  circumstances  accompanying  the  assassination  of  Count  Rossi,  and  reveal  the  practised  hand  of  a  professional  sicario.—Daily  News."
