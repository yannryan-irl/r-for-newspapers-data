The  Champion  of  the  Seas  would  sail,  on  her  return  to  Liverpool,  on  the  25 STYLE=superscript  th  of  October,  with  the  mail  s  ,  The  Melbourne  Argus,  of  the  18th  of  October,  publishes  the  entire  of  the  new  constitution,  and  prefaces  it  with  the  following  remarks  :  It  gives  us  very  sincere  pli'asure  to  be  enabled  to  publish  the  acia  t  of  parliament  em  b  odying  the  new  constitution  act  of  Will  be  Victor,  which  we  received  at  a  late  hour  last  ev  act  ca  ening.  lt,  seen  by  the  27th  clause  that  th  e  new  nnot  take  effect  until  an  act  is  passed  by  the  existing  legislature  for  regulating  the  elections.  We  sincerely  trust  that  no  time  will  be  lost  in  taking  steps  for  this  purpose.  The  grievances  under  which  this  country  has  laboured  for  want  of  adequate  legislation  are  so  great  and  so  numerous,  that  the  remedy  should  be  provided  at  the  earliest  possible  mo moment,  ment, moment,  and  the  executive  will  incur  a  very  heavy  responsibi responsibi:tty  :tty responsibi:tty  should  it  hereafter  appear  that  any  unnecessary  delay  :aas  occurred  in  the  matter  from  their  omission  or  neglect.  gloryOn  the  other  hand,  it  will  be  to  them  a  subject  of  pride  and  ,  and  o  f  gratitude  by  the  colonists,  if  by  their  agency  his  the  most  progressive  and  important  colony  of  the  Australian  gr  gi  ou STYLE=superscript  ,should  be  th  e  fi  rst  to  achieve  the  great  privilege  of  l STYLE=superscript  estive  and  practical  independence.  The  offieirl  return  of  the  en STYLE=superscript  ding  the  30th  of  September,  had  b  een  published.  Quarter's  R  evenue  The  following  is  a  synopsis  :  revenue  Although  an  apparent  i  ncrease  is  shown  on  the  general  ,  the  return,  even  in  this  branch  of  it,  is  not  very  flattering  to  our  pro  period  gress  durin  g  t  h  e  l  ast  twelve  months,  a  ,  be  it  retnemb:red.  in  which  our  population  has  in increased  creased increased  by  some  fifty  thousand  souls,  or  at  the  rate  of  16  per  cent.  on  the  gross  population  of  the  colony.  Under  the  head  of  the  general  revenue,  the  present  return  shows  a  decrease  upon  the  gold  revenue  of  £57,536  for  the  clear clearter,  ter, clearter,  and  of  £196,620  for  the  year.  To  counterbalance  this,  under  the  head  of  custom  g,  we  have  an  i  - STYLE=superscript  crease  recorded  of  £147,712  for  toe  quarter,  and  £159,971  for  the  year.  A  different  arrangement  the  natureis,  however,  necessary  to  illustrate  the  dutythe  on  gold  included,  would  amount  t  o  £142  ,218  for  for  qu  or  £39505  ,0  for  th  e  year  ;  against  £105,198  the  quarter,  and  £456,062  for  the  year,  in  the  cor corresponding  responding corresponding  periods  of  1834.  Deducting  the  gold  duty  from  the  other  Custom's  revenue,  we  should  then  find  the  amounts  to  be  £239,822  for  the  quarter,  ad  £950,575  for  the  ye  ar  ;  against  £186,666  for  the  quarter,  n STYLE=superscript  and  £926,213  for  the  year,  in  September,  1854.  This  view  of  the  case,  which  we  apprehend  to  be  the  only  correct  one,  exhibits  only  the  following  small  balance  in  our  favour,  under  the  receipt  of  several  new  duties  imposed  since  September,  1854:  to  the  •  The  Qqarfer.

September,  1855,  239,822  950,575  The  larger  ratio  of  increase  visible  on  t  u  ne  quarter,  as  compared  with  the  year,  is  owing  to  the  adoitional  duties  above  alluded  to,  finding  no  place  in  the  September  quarter  of  1854.

Pines  and  forfeitures  collected  at  petty  sess,  show  a  marked  deerpase  both  on  the  year  and  quarter,  viz.  £10,341  and  £4,858  !  an  indication,  we  trust,  of  diminished  drunkenness,  petty  breaches  other  m  i  nor  statuteable  of  the  peace,  a  nd  offences,  The  decline  'under  th  e  head  of  territoral  revenue  is  of  great  magnitude.  In  t STYLE=superscript  he  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  crown  lands,  the  decrease  for  the  quarter  is  £305,185,  and  for  the  year  £704,229.
