"AUSTRIA  From  Vienna  (Jan.  21),  we  learn  that  on  that  day  there  was  no  news  worthy  of  mention,  except exceptting  ting exceptting  that  the  most  strenuous  efforts  are  now  being  made  to  induce  England  not  to  insist  on  Russia's  disarming  the  eastern  coast  of  the  Black  Sea.  In  diplomatic  circles  complaints  are  made  of  the  inconceivable  of  Sir  Hamilton  Seymour  in  this  matter,  and  it  may  therefore  be  concluded  shat  he  does  not  consider  it  advisable  that  Great  Britain  should  obey  the  behests  of  a  Power  which  will  largely  partake  of  the  profits,  al although  though although  it  has  not  shared  in  any  of  the  dangers  of  the  war.  It  is  clearly  understood  that  the  consuls  of  the  Allied  powers  are  to  be  allowed  to  reside  at  the  different  Russian  ports  in  the  Black  Sea,  and  it  ig  probable  that  Austria  also  agrees  with  the  Western  Powers  in  thinking  that  Russia  must  pledge  her herself  self herself  never  again  to  fortify  the  Aland  Islands.  The  Austrians  are  extremely  desirous  to  have  the  pre preliminaries  liminaries preliminaries  of  peace  signed  off-hand,  but  it  is  fore-'  seen  that  the  British  government  will  not  consent  to  do  so  until  a  perfectly  clear  and  satisfactory  interpretation  has  been  given  to  the  fifth  sition."
