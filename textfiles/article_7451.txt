"THE  WAR,  FRANCE.  Up  to  the  hour  at  which  we  went  to  press  the  letters  of  our  Paris  correspondent,  of  Monday's  date  had  not  reached  us.  We  learn,  however,  by  despatches  from  Marseilles  dated  yesterday,  9.10  a.m.,  that  the  Indus  had  arrived  with  advices  from  Constantinople  of  the  24th,  and  from,the  Crimea  of  the  .22nd  ult.  The  English  steamer  Vulcan,  which  left  the  Crimea  on  the  15th  December  had  arrived  with  200  soldiers  on  board.  The  Paris  papers,  not  arrive  until  a  late  hour  contain  nothing  of  political  importance.  Accounts  from  Marseilles  state  that  the  commis-'  sion  for  cutting  through  the  Isthmus  of  Suez  had  returned  from  UpPer  Egypt,  and  that  the  results  of  the  inqury  had  proved  most  satisfactory.  Letters  from  Konigsburg  speak  of  the  great  joy  expressed  at  St.  Petersburg  by  the  anticipation  of  a  return  to  peace.  We  have-advises  from  S  Petersburg,  to  the  date  3rd  ultimo  n  that  the  Minister  of  War  has  vertised  for  the  supply  of  139  complete  mortar"
