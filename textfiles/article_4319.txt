Wellington-street  North,  Strand,  August  27,  1868.  tarOtra  attn.  TUESDAI  VOVEMBER  22,  1853  SEcßET.diplomacy  in  political  circles  is  held.  to  be  an  usurpation  of  a  public  right,  which  gives  to  a  single  Minister,  or  a  few  men  forming  a  Cabinet,  the  .  power  of  entailing  endless  misery  and  losses  on  a  country.  In  this  opinion  we  not  only  concur  to  the  fullest  extent,  but  we  contend,  also,  that  where  any  point  involving  any  one  national  interest  is  to  be  discussed,  the  niiblic  should  be  admitted  to  iti'discussion,  and  , STYLE=superscript  where  an  opinion  is  to  be  expressed,  the  national  voice  should  proclaim  it.  Suppose  the  AUTOCRAT  had  been  dealing  since  July  last  with  the  British  people,  instead  of  the  English  Ministry,  is  it  likely  that  the  Danube  and  Pruth  would  be  the  rivers  of  blood  they  are  at  this  moment?  Suppose  Perth  and  Glasgow  had  protested  openly  and  manfully  against  the  foul  designs  of  the  CZAR.  Had  Manchester  warned  NICHOLAS  of  the  re reprisals  prisals reprisals  Englishmen  would  enforce  if  the  peace  of  the  world  were  disturbed  ;  and,  lastly,  suppose  the  good  people  of  Cork  had  declared  their  willingness  to  take  the  field,  if  only  for  the  sake  of  a  small  taste  of  fighting,  is  it  probable  the  MUSCOVITE  would  have  dared  to  play  the  part  he  has?  If  England  had  ordered  the  Russian  troops  out  of  the  Principalities  within  a  given  time,  as  OMAR  PASHA  did  previous  to  the  commencement  of  hos hostilities,  tilities, hostilities,  is  it  likely  that  the  thousand  Turks,  who  are  said  to  have  been  slain  in  one  battle,  would  have  been  sacrificed  to  a  bloodthirsty  monster  ?  There  is  a  fearful  amount  of  cool  indifference  abroad  on  the  subject  of  shedding  the  blood  of  un unoffending  offending unoffending  men  in  order  to  gratify  the  whim  of  one  wretched  monster.  One  filthy  despot  who,  in  dis disregard  regard disregard  of  all  human  and  Divine  law,  is  suffered  to  dip  his  hand  in  the  blood  .Of  his  fellow-creatures,  and  then  to  hold  it  up  in  triumph  in  the  face  of  GOD  and  man!  It  is  fashionable  to  applaud  heroes  in  such  tragedies?

All  these  phases  of  society,  as  it  is,  date  from  a  governing  principle.  The  argument  is,  it  was  not  for  these  great  men,  these  destroyers  of  mankind,  there  would  not  be  a  man  left  alive.  Statesmen,  churchmen,  and  philosophers  are  all  of  the  same  opinion.  There  is  not  another  subject  connected  with  hitman  affairs,  in  which  so  many  Doctors  of  Divinity  and  Law,  will  tell  one  with  an  air  of  excruciating  gravity,  that  a  life  take  n  in  a  field  of  battle  is  quite  a  different  thing  to  throat-cutting  by  the  way-side.

This  style  of  reasoning  is  no  less  awful  than  amusing,  and  the  low  and  compromising  order  of  morality  to  which  it  belongs,  is  the  stronghold  of  that  secret  diplomacy  which  has  led  to  the  pre present  sent present  war  in  the  East  A  bold  and  independent  Minister  can  have  nothing  to  fear  from  letting  his  acts  and  thoughts  be  known  on  a  subject  of  univer universal  sal universal  interest.  The  stability  of  our  political  system  is  attributed  to  the  fact,  that  every  Englishman  has  a  stake  in  the  country;  and  in  a  case  where  that  stake  is  endangered,  has  not  every  man  a  right  to  know  the  steps  which  are  taken  to  guard  the  national  in-  The  fact  of  a  deputation  of  merchants  having  waited  on  Lord  CLARENDON,  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  what  position  their  property  would  be  in,  in  trading  with  Russia,  under  existing  circum circumstances  stances circumstances  is  a  case  in  point.  They  had  large  sums  employed  in  the  Russian  trade,  and  owing  to  the  silent  of  Downing-street,  they  were  com compelled  pelled compelled  to  go  and  demand  in  person,  some  informa  tion  from  the  Foreign  Secretary.  The  meeting  with  Lord  CLARENDON  was  thus  for formally  mally formally  recorded  :  An  interview  took  place  on  Tuesday,  between  Lord  Cla Clarendon  rendon Clarendon  and  certain  eminent  English  merchants  engaged  in  the  Russian  trade,  whose  object  was  to  gain  from  his  lord lordship  ship lordship  the  expression  of  some  decided  opinion  as  to  the  danger  of  this  trade  being  interrupted  by  possible  political  changes.  It  was  represented  to  his  lordship  that  English  merchants  are  in  the  habit,  at  this  period  of  the  year,  of  making  heavy  contracts  in  St.  Petersburg  for  Russian  produce,  such  as  hemp,  tallow,  &amp;c.,  deliverable  next  season,  and  upon  which  goods  very  heavy  advances,  amounting  sometimes  to  the  entire  contract,  are  made  to  the  Russian  dealers.  The  reply  of  Lord  Clarendon  was  to  the  effect  that,  whilst  her  Majesty's  government  are  using  their  utmost  exertions  to  avert  war,  caution  in  relation  to  these  transactions  is  never nevertheless  theless nevertheless  advisable  :  and,  in  fact,  a  hint  was  given  that  it  would  be  as  well  for  the  Russian  merchants  to  avoid  risking  their  money  under  present  circumstances.  This  interview  formed  a  topic  of  current  conversation  in  commercial  circles  during  the  The  amount  advanced  by  English  merchants  on  Russian  produce  cannot  be  less  than  X  5,000,000  annually.

And  here  we  ask,  what  might  the  Government  have  to  withhold  from  those  mer merchants  chants merchants  the  information  which  is  so  essential  to  the  safety  of  their  capital  ?  Are  the  merchants  of  England  unworthy  of  confidence  where  their  own  interests  are  concerned  ?  Are  the  people  of  England  traitors  to  their  country,  and  their  own  stake  in  its  welfare  ?  Is  there,  after  all,  no  stability  in  our  political  system  beyond  that  which  is  derived  from  secrecy  in  the  administration  of  our  national  affairs  ?  Are  the  mouths  of  my  Lords  ABERDEEN  and  CLARENDON  the  only  channels  through  which  England  is  to  applaud  and  encourage  an  ally,  or  scout  and  denounce  the  enemies  of  mankind  ?  Why,  such  a  thought  may  amuse  a  doting  old  peer  Of  the  eighteenth  century,  but  it  must  not  be  tolerated  by  the  present  age.  The  CzAn's  usurpa usurpation  tion usurpation  of  the  Principalities  is  less  aggresive  than  this  attempt  at  the  usurpation  of  the  rights  of  the  sub subject.  ject. subject.  England  is  not  a  'nation  of  traitors  who  would  betray  the  rights  and  interests  of  their  own  or  any  other  country  to  a  merciless  despot  And  when  she  has  heavy  commercial  interests  pending,  it  is  a  little  too  much  to  require  our  merchants  to  parade  themselves  in  Downing-street  before  they  are  able  to  get  a  even  of  the  position  in  which  their  capital  may  be  placed.  We  have  already  shown  on  several  occasions  the  heavy.  losses  this  country  has  sustained  by  the  de depreciation  preciation depreciation  in  the  value  of  our  public  securities  ;'  the  advance  in  the  prices  of  the  necessaries  of  life,  and  the  suspension  of  employment  caused  by  the  apprehension  of  war,  the  existence  of  which  our  secret  diplomatists  are  still  unwilling  to  admit:  Deputations  having  failed  with  Lord  CLARENDON,  on  Saturday  we  find  that  Lord  PALMERSTON  was  tried  by  Lord  DUDLEY  STUART  and  several  gentle gentlemen,  men, gentlemen,  who  waited  upon  the  Home  Secretary  for  the  purpose  of  presenting  an  address  to  the  Q  UEEN  ,  which  had  been  agreed  to  at  the  recent  meeting  at  the  London  Tavern,  protesting  against STYLE=superscript  Russian  encroachments  on  Turkey.  This  document  not  only  speaks  most  emphatically  on  the  subject  of  foreign  affairs,  but  it  openly  expresses  a  want  of  confidence  in  her  MAJESTY'S  Government,  as  at  present  constituted,  with  reference  to  our-  foreign  policy.  In  reply  to  this  deputation,  Lord  PALMER PALMERSTON  STON PALMERSTON  stated  that  it  was  the  determination  of  the  Government,  at  all  hazards,  to  present  the  ititeg ititegrity  rity ititegrity  of  the  Ottoman  Empire.  This  is  all  very  well  as  far  as  it  goes,  but  how  do  they  propose  to  do  what  they  say  ?  This  is  the  question  the  country  requires  should  be  distinctly  answered.  We  have  had  a  volume  of  similar  assurances  within  the  last  six  mouths,  and  yet  the  Turks  are  left  to  cope  with  an  enemy  which  the  Government  admits  is  capable  of  swallowing  up  the  empire  which  they  say  England  is  bound  to  protect  and  uphold.  What  order  of  diplomacy  is  this?  To  what  school  of  administration  does  it  belong  ?  The  future  may  explain  an  anomaly  which  baffles  the  sagacity  of  the  present  THE  pretended  miracle  of  La  like  its  counter-part,  the  Holy  Coat  of  we  thought  had  long  ago  been  exploded.  We  have,  however,  been  very  much  mistaken.  It  appears  that  in  some  quarters  the  story  is  received  with  the  greatest  credulity;  and  it  has  arrived  at  such  im importance  portance importance  that  the  other  evening  the  inhabitants  of  Liverpool  were  enlightened  with  a  lecture  on  the  subject  by  Mr.  SPENCER  NORTHCOTE.  Really,  we  have  no  patience  with  such  rampant  superstition.  We  are  by  no  means  hostile  to  any  system  of  religious  belief;  but  we  cannot  be  silent  whilst  such  ridiculous  legends  are  gravely  spoken  of  as  true  by  men  old  enough  to  have  better  sense.  It  is  positively  absurd  at  a  time  when  every  long longcherished  cherished longcherished  belief  is  being  brought  to  the  test  of  reason—when  the  contest  between  Philosophy  and  Dogma  wages  hotter  and  stronger  than  ever,  to  have  such  thrust  down  our  throats  as  undeniable  verities.  'Twill  never  do.  Our  pro progress,  gress, progress,  at  all  events,  slow  though  it  be,  is  forward— forwardnot  not forwardnot  backward;  and  Supernaturalism  must  take  up  its  abode  in  that  deep  abyss—  Where  entity  and  quidity,  The  ghosts  of  defunct  follies  If  once  we  allow  Superstition  to  take  the  place  of  Reason,  there  is  no  telling  what  absurdities  we  may  receive—manifest  evidences  of  which  we  may  observe  in  those  countries  where  the  reasoning  faculties  of  the  people  meet  with  little  or  no  cultiva cultivation.  tion. cultivation.

Now  we  conceive  that  the  bare  mention  of  such  gross  delusions  and  impositions  must  excite  not  only  the  laughter  but  the  indignation  of  all  reasonable  men  of  every  creed;  and  our  only  wonder  is  that,  in  enlightened  England,  any  one  could  be  found  pre  sumptuous  or  foolish  enough  to  undertake  the  defence  of  such  extravagant  folly.  Doubtless,  in  the  line  other  countries  are  more  highly  favoured  than  our  own;  and  were  it  not  for  the  occa occasional  sional occasional  spiritual  manifestations  with  which  we  are  occasionally  visited,  we  might  well  be  jealous  of  the  privilege  thus  unduly  conferred.  Of  course,  we  have  had  a  in  Chelsea  the  other  day;  but  we  English  being  so  very  incredulous  paid  it  no  further  attention  than  to  abuse  it  right  heartily.  Had  it  appeared  any  where  else  it  would  be  univer universally  sally universally  hailed  as  a  supernatural  event  ;  and  there  is  not  a  doubt  but  that  the  same  would  become  a  standing  and  authentic  miracle  by  this  time.  One  question,  however,  puzzles  us  sorely,  and  it  is  this.  How  comes  it  to  pass  that  those  countries  so  famed  for  their  miraculous  manifestations  are  inva invariably  riably invariably  remarkable  for  the  absence  of  all  trade  and  commerce  ;  and  that  their  inhabitants  are  of  the  lowest  condition  of  intellect,  steeped  in  poverty,  misery,  and  degradation—whilst  such  a  country  as  our  own,  where  our  public  monuments  never  wink  an  eye,  move  a  limb,  or  deign  to  take  a  midnight  walk  abroad  ;  and  the  pictures  at  the  National  Gallery  remain  quietly  suspended  from  the  walls  —  never  condescending  to  recognise  the  multitudes  who  almost  daily  throng  to  view  them—is  growing  in  commercial  prosperity  and  greatness,  and  has  become  signalised  above  all  other  nations?  Now,  which  is  the  greater  miracle  ?  The  circumstance  attending  the  alleged  miracle  are  as  follows  :  On  the  19th  September,  1852,  at  La  Salette,  an  apparation  of  beautiful  lady,  clothed  in  white,  wearing  a  chaplet  of  pearls  and  gar garland  land garland  of  appeared  to  a  boy  and  girl  of  the  respective  ages  of  11  and  15  years,  whilst  employed  in  minding  cattle  on  a  neighbouring  mountain.  The  apparition  complained  with  bitterness  and  tears  of  the  gross  immorality  of  the  villagers,  in  neglecting  to  keep  holidays  and  the  /emits  ofthe  Church—speak Church—speaking  ing Church—speaking  first  in  pure  French  ;  but  to  suit  the  illiterate  capacities  addressed,  subsequently  adopting  the  patois  of  the  district.  We,  in  our  ignorance,  are  at  a  loss  to  conceive  why  the  apparition  did  not  em employ  ploy employ  the  latter  mode  at  first  !  but  we  say  this  by•  way  ofparenthesis.  However,  'as  the  story  goes,  it  then  commissioned  those  children  to  make  known  all  that  was  said  to  them  :  but  subsequently  took  them  apart,  and  uttered  some  secret  into  the  ear  of  each,  at  the  same  time  giving  them  strict  in injunctions,  junctions, injunctions,  that  such  should  not  be  divulged.  The  Ghost  then  took  to  its  heels,  leaving  the  poor  terrified  urchins  to  gaze  at  vacancy!  Immediately  an  intermittent  spring  in  the  neighbourhood,  known  to  be  occasionally  dried  up,  poured  forth  spontaneously  ;  and  has  never  since  become  ex  hausted  !  Of  course  there  is  no  end  to  the  num number  ber number  of  miraculous  cures  wrought  by  the  water  of  this  fountain;  and  there  can  be  little  doubt  that  it  has  yielded,  and  does  still  yield,  an  ample  return  to  the  owner  of  the  property  in  which  it  is  situated  Whoever  got  up  the  apparition  evidently  had  an  eye  to  business.  Pious  frauds,  even  within  our  own  remembrance  have  proved  highly  successful  modes  for  renewing  empty  exchequers  and  getting  grist  together.  And  all  acquainted  with  history  need  not  be  told  how  productive  such  schemes  have  been,  when  once  sanctioned  by  ecclesiastical  authority.  -  We  cannot  conceive  how  such  hobgoblin  stories  can  publicly  be  advocated  in  the  broad  daylight  of  the  Nineteenth  century,  and  of  all  other  places  in  the  world,  in  England  !  Our  country  and  our  people  have  long  since  outgrown  such  follies— folliesthey.have  they.have folliesthey.have  no  chance  whatever  of  passing  current  with  us—so  the  best  thing  that  can  be  done  with  them  is  to  confine  them  exclusively  to  their  native  soil,  where,  no  doubt  they  will  meet  ready  accept•  mice,  and  yield  a  more  substantial  and  profitable  return  !  We,  as  a  people,  have  obtained  a  character  for  common  sense,  and  we  have  no  disposition  whatever  to  exchange  the  same  for  a  cap  and  bells  r  If  ever  we  should  feel  disposed  to  indulge  our  imagination  in  the  supernatural,  we  have  plenty  of  sources  to  turn  to  without  having  re recourse  course recourse  to-the  hotchpotch  tale  of  the  La  Salette  apparition.  There  is  not  an  old  woman  we  meet  who  cannot  afford  us  some  gratification  in  that  way,  and  tell  an  infinitely  far  better  story  of  some  weird  sprite  !
