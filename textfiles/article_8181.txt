"THE  CANADIAN  TIMBER  TRADE.  (From  Messrs:  Forsyth,  Bell,  Co.'s  Annual  ar;ular.)  Quebec,  21st  December,  1855.  We  think  it  a  matter  of  congratulation  that,  although  the  war  continues,  and  money  is  in  unprecedented  demand,  the  prospects  are  good  for  mostly  all  articles  of  timber,  and  in  reviewing  the  business  of  the  past  season  our  remarks  contrast  strongly  and  favourably  with  those  in  our  last  annual  Circular.  Then,  all  was  doubt  and  uncertainty  both  in  England  and  in  Canada  in  respect  to  our  reports  of  wool,  and  the  only  true  corrective  (as  Messrs.  Churchill  and  Sim  rightly  stated)  lay  in  greatly  reducing  the  manufacture  of  timber  and  deals.  So  great,  however,  is  the  stock  of  the  latter  both  in  London  and  Quebec  that  the  same  course  must  still  be  pursued  before  prices  can  rally.  Money  continues  scarce,  and  our  banks  from  baying  fur  many  years  been  far  to)  liberal  in  granting  credits,  are  now  rather  inclined  to  o  into  the  other  extreme,  and  we  cannot  avoid  cautioning  our  friends  on  the  Ottawa  and  St.  Lawrence  against  embarking  into  transactions  in  the  hopes  of  finding  money  easily  procurable  in  winter.  There  seemq  a  growing  impression  that  because  our  markets  closed  firmly  and  the  price  is  good  in  Liverpool  that  it  mus►  be  exceedingly  high  all  next  scaion,  but  when  we  refer  to  the  stocks  wintering,  and  bring  to  mind  the  difficulty  last  year  experienced  in  proc  ring  tonnage,  even  when  freights  advanced,  we  think  we  owe  it  to  all  interested  in  the  trade  to  state  that  should  freights  c  mtiuue  in  as  great  request  in  England  as  they  have  been  for  some  time  past,  that  it  is  not  only  possible,  but  very  probable,  that  our  tonnage  nest  year  may  not  exceed  that  of  the  past  one,  the  effect  of  which  would  be  very  prejudicial  to  the  manufacturer  of  timber  and  deals.  By  the  mail  just  received,  we  find  prices  in  Liverpool  are  not  so  buoyant,  but  the  import  from  Quebec  is  low.  With  these  general  remal  ks  we  will  consider  each  article  separately,  and  in  that  of  White  Pine  have  to  give  a  stock  of  91  1  millions  of  feet  wintering  this  year,  against  7.1  last  season,  while  the  export  has  been  about  11  millions,  against  I9i  last  year.  It  opened  in  spring  with  great  dullness  and  langour,  and  it  was  not  till  large  purchases  were  made,  late  in  summer,  that  prices  rallied,  and  continued  steadily  but  gradually  to  advance,  the  market  in  England  showing  more  than  a  corresponding  rise.  In  our  Circular,  early  in  Sep September,:we  tember,:we September,:we  stated  our  conviction  that  the  supply  would  be  six  or  seven  millions  short  of  last  year,  and  though  many  thought  we  bad  under-rated  the  quantity  coming  forward,  we  find  the  difference  is  within  a  fraction  of  the  lesser  amount,  being  13,574,685  feet  in  1855,  against  19,648,006  feet  in  18.51.  Our  quotations  are  the  present  asking  prices,  although  there  have  been  some  large  sales  made  lately  of  66  feet  at  81,  and  a  raft  of  as  small  an  average  as  50  feet  within  the  last  week  at  61,  measured  off.  In  1851  a  good  number  of  rafts  of  fine  quality,  wintered  over  in  the  Ottawa,  but  This  season  almost  every  raft  got  to  market,  and  we  cannot  look  for  any  superior  timber  early  next  spring,  so  that  all  the  vessels  coming  out  in  May  and  June,  will  have  to  look  to  the  stock  on  hand,  much  of  which  is  of  ordinary  quality  WHITE  PINE  1855.  1854.

A  great  portion  of  it  is  small,  and  a  good  deal  two  years  old  ;  and,  while  small  timber  is  dull,  large  com commands  mands commands  a  fair  price,  and  we  quote  40  feet  in  the  raft  at  ls.  What  is  manufactured  this  winter  should  be  at  least  45  feet  good  and  straight,  for  inferior  timber  has  all  the  season  been  placed  with  difficulty,  and,  in  many  cases,  at  extremely  low  rates.

A  great  deal  in  market  is  middling  in  quality,  and  for  the  last  two  seasons  less  care  has  been  taken  in  the  manufacture  than  in  previous  years.  OAK—  1855.  1854.

In  operations  now  going  on  in  the  woods,  we  recommend  parties  to  get  nothing  but  large  sized  girthy  timber,  and  we  think  they  may  calculate  on  fair  prices  for  either  flitted  or  square,  if  this  suggestion  be  attended  to.

Both  last  season  and  this,  the  quantity  of  Culls  has  been  ruinously  large,  and  the  heavy  losses  entailed  on  the  parties  who  sent  them  to  market,  will  doubtless  have  the  effect  of  more  care  and  circumspection  being  shown  in  purchasing  on  the  Like  shore  than  has  been  lately  used.

Many  of  our  large  mills  are  either  absolutely  closed  or  working  on  a  limited  scale,  and  as  deals  have  seen  the  worst  in  London,  we  need  not  be  surprised  to  see  a  gradual  rise  next  season.

The  difference  in  our  tonnage  is  very  striking,  and  so  many  vessels  being  employed  by  government  and  in  other  trades,  make  Freights  still  high  in  England,  and  ships  are  in  request.  New  ships  have  of  late  been  commanding  more  attention  than  during  the  last  twelve  months,  partly  owing  to  the  c  'uses  just  mentioned,  of  a  rise  in  freights,  and  partly  from  their  admipance  into  France.  It  is  only  lately  this  privilege  has  been  granted,  and  we  have  not  heard  of  any  orders  in  consequence  ;  but,  as  a  caution  to  ship  builders  on  the  spot,  we  may  mention,  of  the  27  vessels  built  here  last  winter,  only  eight  have  been  sold  up  to  Ist  December.

The  Times  says  .—We  anticipate  from  Russia  neither  a  refusal  nor  an  acceptance,  but  such  a  modified  counter  proposition  as  may  give  rise  to  negoeiations  and  enable  her  to  play  off  upon  us  the  devices  of  another  pacification  and  another  conference.  We  trust  that  such  insiduous  overtures  will  be  pere.nptorily  refused.  It  is  absolutely  requisite  for  the  very  existence  of  the  government  that  it  should  meet  parliament  with  a  decided  announcement  of  peace  or  war.
