"THE  WEST  INDIES,  We  have  received  our  usual  files  of  Barbadoes  journals,  dated  down  to  the  9th  of  August.  The  steamer  Conway  had  arrived  on  the  6th  of  August,  with  the  English  and  Northern  mails;  the  former  of  which  were  brought  to  St.  Thomas  by  the  Magdelena.  Thursday,  the  11th  of  August,  the  Governor  had  by  proclamation  set  apart  to  commemorate  the  hurricane  of  1831,  which  was  to  be  kept  as  a  holiday  in  consequence.  The  House  of  Assembly  met  upon  the  26th  of  July,  pursuant  to  adjournmentâ€”the  Hon.  John  Thomas,  Speaker,  in  the  chair.  The  Solicitor-General  moved  the  first  reading  of  his  bill  for  the  protection  of  Mr.  Brandies  in  the  use  of  his  discovery  for  the  improvement  of  sugar.  Mr.  King  seconded  the  motion,  and  it  was  read  a  first  time,  and  ordered  to  be  printed.  The  Court  of  Grand  Sessions  was  opened  on  the  2d  of  August.  The  calendar  was  light.  ANTIGUA  We  learn  that  the  yellow  fever  had  moderated  a  good  deal  at  Antigua,  but  at  Dominica  it  had  re reappeared,  appeared, reappeared,  and  carried  off  a  commissariat  clerk  and  the  wife  of  an  officer  of  the  ordnance.  As  usual,  in  this  island,  there  are  a  great  many  disputes  about  legal  matters  and  appointments  to  the  courts,  which  possess  no  interest  outside  of  the  place."
