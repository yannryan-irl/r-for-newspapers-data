"MUNICIPAL  ELECTIONS,  On  Saturday  three  members  were  elected  to  the  Town  Council  for  Pitt-street,  Abercromby,  and  South  Toxteth  Wards,  in  the  room  of  the  threemembers  for  those  wards  whq  had  been  appointed  aldermen  at  the  last  meeting  of  the  newly-elected  Town  Council.  Two  of  the  wards,  Aber Abercromby  cromby Abercromby  and  Pitt-street,  were  contested.  Mr.  W.  Earle  was  the  liberal  candidate  for  Abercromby  Ward,  and  Mr.  T.  Lee  the  conservative  candidate.  Mr.  John  Smith  was  the  liberal  candidate  for  Pitt-street  Ward,  and  Mr.  W.  Mann  the  conservative  candidate.  In  Abercromby  Ward  we  are  gratified  to  be  able  to  announce  the  triumph  of  liberal  principles  . STYLE=superscript  ;  whilst  in  Pitt-street  Ward  the  conservatives  were  successful—  a  second  time  defeating  Mr.  J.  Smith,  but  on  this  occasion  by  a  limited  majority.  In  South  Toxteth  Ward  there  was  no  opposition,  Mr.  J.  Robertson,  conservative,  was  returned.  Mr.  Robertson  is  a  member  of  the  firm  of  Rebertson  and  Ewing,  timber-merchants.  Throughout  the  day  a  great  deal  of  interest  was  evinced  as  to  the  result  of  the  contest  in  Abercromby  Ward,  and  cars  might  be  seen  in  all  directions  bearing  placards  on  which  were  printed  Aber Abercromby  cromby Abercromby  Ward—Earle  for  Similar  placards  were  also  exhibited  on  Mr.  Lee's  vehicles.  From  an  early  period  it  was  evident  that  Mr.  Smith  could  not  succeed  in  Pitt-street,  but,  next  to  success,  nothing  could  be  more  pleasing  to  his  friends  than  the  smallness  of  the  majority  by  which  his  opponent  was  elected,  as  compared  with  that  by  which  Mr.  Jeffreys  was  returned  on  the  Ist  of  November.  We  subjoin  a  detailed  account  of  the  proceedings  in  each  Ward."
