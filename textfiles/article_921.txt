We  will  therefore  the  Austrian  Exchequer,  it  ay  eeded  that  for  the  same  period  iillions  of  florins,  and  from  the  same  period  in  1851,  by  fifteen  millions  of  florins  The  dates  here  given  embrace  a  period  of  peace,  in  which  the  Austrian  Exchequer'  has  advanced  slightly  in  its  receipts,  and  if  the  closing  half  of  the  present  fiscal  year  be  as  produCtive  as  the  first,  which,  by  the  way  is  very  problematical,  the  total  revenue  for  the  current  year  will  amount  to  two  hundred  and  six  millions  of  florins,  while  in  1832,  the  total  revenue  of  the  country  amounted  to  two  hundred  and  four  millions  of  florins  only,  and  in  1847,  to  the  insignificant  sum  of  one  hundred  and  These  figures  are  all  very  well,  and  would  be  highly  satisfactory,  if  it  was  not  for  the  rather  siri  J  much  paper,  for  ;ary,  the  honour  of  which  ti  and  the  unavenged  acts  of  Austrian  emu  Ispotism  are  pledged.  How  long  this  basis  of  Austria's  financial  prosperity  can  be  su  tained  is  difficult  to  understand.

That  AuStria,  under  these  circumstances,  should  resort  to  a  lottery,  is  by  no  means  surprising.
