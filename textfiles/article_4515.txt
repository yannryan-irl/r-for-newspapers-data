"FRANCE.  The  Moniteur  of  Wednesday  publishes  a  decree  which  fixes  the  duty  on  foreign  coke  brought  into  France  at  30c.  for  every  hundred  kilogrammes  in  French  vessels,  and  80c.  in  foreign  vessels.  The  duty  on  raw  cast-iron  (fonte  brute)  is  fixed  at  sf.  per  hundred  kilogrammes  ;  and  changing  duties  (droits  varians)  on  other  sorts  of  iron.  After  1855  the  duty  on  raw  cast-iron  will  be  4f.,  and  on  other  sorts  of  iron  in  proportion.  A  report  is  current  in  Bucharest  that  Klapka  was  in  command  of  the  Turkish  artillery  attached  to  this  corps."
