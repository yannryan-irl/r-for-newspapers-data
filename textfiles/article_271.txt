"ference,  Assuming  that  Austria  does  commit  herself  to  Russia,  she  by  that  policy  becomes  hostile  to  the  Western  Powers.  She  commits  herself  irrevocably  to  the  principle  of  coercive  and  arbitrary  govern government  ment government  even  more  than  she  has  already  ,  and  by  that  act  assumes  the  position  of  the  Power  which  has  most  to  lose  and  least  to  gain  out  of  the  conflict.  She  voluntarily  incurs  most  serious  peril  for  an  impossible  object;  and  runs  more  serious  risks  of  dismemberment  than  at  any  time  during  her  re-  verses  under  Napoleon.  Should  war  arise,  Austria  therefore  will  become  as  great  a  point  of  interest,  both  in  a  military  and  a  political  sense,  as  Turkey.  She  will  indeed,  ir  one  respect,  present  superior  features  of  interest  for  she  will  have  to  contend  at  once  with  a  revo  lutionary  spirit  throughout  her  heterogenous  do  minions,  the  fanatic  resentment  of  the  Turks  and  the  military  power  of  France.  Here  are  difficulties  enough  to  induce  her  to  pause.  Add  to  these  the  fact  that  she  is  bankrupt  in  'purse  and  destitute  o:  credit,  and  some  idea  may  be  obtained  of  he]  ability  to  carry  on  a  lengthened  contest  against  the  Powers  of  the  West."
