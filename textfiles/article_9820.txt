The  Western  Powers  took  upon  themselves  a  Christian  duty,  but  had  no  objects  in  the  war  beyond  those  which  form  a  conspicuous  part  in  all  just  and  humane  undertakings.  They  went  to  war  to  enforce  peace,  as  the  heroes  of  France,  Germany,  Poland,  and  Spain  resisted  the  yoke  of  VANDALI.  Civilised  nations  fight  for  repose,  and  not  for  the  mere  shedding  of  blood.  Barbarous  nations  only  invade  other  countries  on  a  simple  pretext;  and  where  Europe  is  afflicted  the  Presence  of  upwards  of  60,000,000  of  Muscovites  civilization  must  defend  semi-barbarot  itself.
