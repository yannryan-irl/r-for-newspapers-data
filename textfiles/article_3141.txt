SUGAR:  Enquiry  continues  brisk,  but  our  stocks  are  mostly  in  second  hands,  and  it  is  hardly  possible  to  make  up  a  cargo,  the  small  lots  which  appear  in  the  market  are  bought  up  at  the  quotations.  The  exports  for  the  month  have  been  5,186  cases,  140  boxes,  and  6,046  barrels  and  bags.

COFFEE  :  Small  lots  from  the  interior  were  disposed  of  at  $4  per  arroba  ;  in  the  beginning  of  the  week  1,500  bags  Caravellas  will  be  offered  for  sale  by  public  auction  ;  the  ex expected  pected expected  800  bags  from  thence  have  not  made  their  appearance.
