"Three  Sostre,  Wells,  from  Liverpool  .  k!  Christiana  The  Challenge,  from  China  to  London,  which  put  in  here,  Oct  20,  leaky.  is  calculated  to  have  damaged  upwards  of  1300  chests  of  tea.  That  still  on  board,  is  in  such  a  bad  state,  that  it  will  be  thrown  overboard.  If  the  ship  cannot  be  repaired  here,  she  will  be  sent  on  to  Lisbon,  with  more  men  and  pumps,"
