And  I  find‘the  there  was  no  look-out,  kept,  and  no  order  made  by  the  pilot  that  a  look-out  should  be  kept.  Upon  these  facts,  I  shall  look  over  the  case,  and  see  whether  they  render  the  pilot  liable..  His  Honour  then  intimated  that,  as  he  should  have  to  deliver  judgment  in  another  collision  case  recently  heard,  he  should  decide  both  on  the  same  day.

'  Yesterday,  the  Right  Rev.  the  Lord  Bishop  of  Manchester  consecrated  the  new  church  of  St.  Stephen,  situated  in  Milton-street,  Stockport-road,  upwards  of  two  miles  from  the  Manchester  Exchange.  Notwithstanding  the  inclemency  of  the  weather,  there  was  a  numerous  attendance  of  clergy  and  laity.  Amongst  the  clergy  present  we  noticed,  in  addition  to  the  bishop,  the  Rev.  G.  H.  G.  Anson,  the  Rev.  Hugh  Stowell,  the  Rev.  E.  Birch,  the  Rev.  Robert  Walker,  the  Rev.  Wm.  Doyle  (incumbent  of  the  church),  the  Rev.  Dr.  Carpenter,  the  Rev.  William  Huntington,  &amp;c.  ;  amongst  the  laity,  were  John  Sharp,  Esq.,  Richard  Birley,  Esq.,  &amp;c.,  &amp;c.  This  church  has  been  raised,  partly  by  a  grant  from  Queen  Anne's  Bounty  and  partly  by  subscriptions,  but  chiefly  by  the  latter,  promoted  in  an  eminent  measure  by  the  exertions  of  the  Rev.  E.  Birch,  of  St.  Saviour's,  with  whom  Mr.  Doyle,  the  incumbent  of  the  new  church,  was  formerly  curate.  The  amount  of  the  contract  for  the  building  of  the  church  and  parsonage-house  adjoining,  was  somewhat  near  6000/.  About  nine  months  ago  the  erection  of  the  building  was  commenced,  the  architect  being  Mr.  E.  H.  Shellard  of  Manchester.  The  church,  which  is  in  the  decorated  Gothic  style  of  architecture,  consists  of  a  nave,  two  transepts,  chancel  and  vestry,  and  tower  and  spire.  The  length  of  the  structure  from  E.  to  W.  is  80  feet  7  inches.  The  width  of  the  body  of  the  church  from  N.  to  S.  is  40  feet.  The  two  transepts  are  each  19  feet  in  length,  from  N.  to  S.,  and  26  feet  in  width  from  E.  to  W.  The  height  of  the  roof  is  48  feet.  The  roof  is  an  open  one,  with  circular  ribs.  There  are  three  galleries,  one  at  the  west  end,  and  one  in  each  of  the  transepts.  The  sacred  edifice  is  seated  for  the  accommoda accommodation  tion accommodation  of  1000  persons,  and  one-third  of  the  sittings  are  free.  The  church  is  built  entirely  of  Yorkshire  stone.
