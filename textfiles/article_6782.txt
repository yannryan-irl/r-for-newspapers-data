"POLICE  COURT.-‘-SATURDAY  Patrick  Tyrreyabourer,  was  charged  with  attempting  to  pick  the  pockets  of  several  women  in  St.  George's  market,  on  Friday  night.  The  markets  at  the  present  moment  swarm  with  light  fingered  gentlemen,  who  no  doubt  expect  to  glean  considerable  pickings  from  the  crowds  of  purchasers  and  sight-seers,  who  visit  them.  The  prisoner  said  he  had  been  for  seventeen  years  in  Liverpool,  and  had  never  before  been  charged  with  an  offence.  He  was  discharged  with  a  caution.  Ca*rim  Blake,  and  Catherine  .3P  Donald,  women  of  the  town,  were  charged  by  a  sailor,  named  Robert  Johnson,  with  robbing  him  of  eight  sovereigns.  The  prosecutor,  who  was  at  the  time  somewhat  the  worse  for  drink,  met  the  first  named  prisoner  in  the  street,  and  was  induced  to  accompany  her  to  her  house  in  3  Court,  Charles-street.  In  waking  in  the  morning  he  found  himself  minus  his  money,  and  learned  from  the  other  prisoner  that  his  companion  hadleft  him  shortly  after  they  had  retired  to  rest.  Catherine  Blake  was  committed  for  two  [months  ;  the  other  prisoner  was  dis  charged.  Sarah  Magrath  was  committed  for  two  months,  for  steal stealing  ing stealing  a  goose  on  Friday  evening,  from  a  stall  in  St.  John's  market.  The  prisoner,  who  was  cleanly  clad,  had  a  fine  little  child  in  her  arms,  and  she  seemed  much  more  solici solicitous  tous solicitous  about  its  comfort  than  her  own  fate.  Margaret  Bennett,  an  old  and  wretchedly-clad  woman,  was  remanded  on  a  charge  of  stealing  a  quantity  of  wearing  apparel  from  Mrs.  Bolton,  21,  Sun  -street.  James  .M'Cartney,  18,  was  committed  for  three  months,  for  having  in  his  possession,  in  St.  George's  dock,  a  quantity  of  canvass  for  which•  he  could  not  account,  and  for  assault assaulting  ing assaulting  the  police-officer  when  arrested.  The  officer,  No.  152,  stated  that  when  he  arrested  the  prisoner  he  became  exceedingly  violent,  and  when  he  was  bringing  him  along  the  street,  a  crowd  gathered  round  them,  and  commenced  to  hustle  them.  They  forced  from  the  officer  the  bag  containing  the  canvass,  and  had  almost  succeeded  in  rescuing  the  prisoner.  PASSING  BASE  COIN.—A  woman,  of  the  name  of  Ryan,  about  30  years  of  age,  was  charged  with  attempting  to  pass,  at  a  chandler's  shop,  a  base  shilling.  When  arrested  by  the  officerlshe  immediately  swallowed  the  shilling.  She  has  been  six  times  before  the  court  for  a  like  offence.  t3he  was  five  times  acquitted,  and  convicted  once.  She  was  remanded  for  seven  days.  PASSENGERS'  ACT.—Edward  Gardner  Willoughby  and  Seymour  Willoughby,  owners  of  the  paddle  steamer  Britannia,  were  summoned  for  having  allowed  the  above  vessel  to  ply  and  carry  passengers  between  Birkenhead  and  Liverpool  on  the  29th  of  November,  without  having  a  proper  sailing  certificate.  Mr.  W.  Tindall  appeared  for  the  crown,  and  one  of  the  Messrs.  Willoughby  defended  in  person.  He  admitted  the  fact,  but  contended  that  they  should  not  be  held  guilty  of  the  offence,  inasmuch  as  he  had  applied  to  have  the  boat  surveyed  in  October,  and  did  not  receive  the  current  certifi certificate  cate certificate  until  the  sth  of  this  month.  The  old  certificate  was  in  the  boat,  but  it  had  expired  on  the  18th  of  November.  The  defendants  were  fined  20s.  and  costs,  and  the  master,  10s.  and  costs.  BIRKENHEAD  COUNTY  COURT-SATURDAY.  A  SHORING  SMITH'S  LIABILITY  Taomes  JONES  v.  JOHN  SANKEY.—By  this  action  the  plaintiff,  a  dealer  in  horses,  residing  in  Birkenhead,  sought  to  recover  from  defendant,  a  shoeing  smith  and  farrier,  the  sum  of  35.,  as  compensation,  the  value  of  a  horse,  which  'ivit  - STYLE=superscript  s  on'  the  23d  of  June  last  entrusted  t  o  th  e  defendant  for  llhoeing,  and  which  horse,  through  the  negligence  and  care carelessness  lessness carelessness  of  the  defendant,  did  languish  and  die.  The  case  for  the  plaintiff  was  conducted  by  Mr.  Gates Gateshead,  head, Gateshead,  and  the  defendant  was  represented  by  Mr.  Bretherton.  For  the  plaintiff,  it  was  alleged  that  he  had,  on  the  23d  of  June,  sent  the  horse  to  the  defendant's  smithy  to  be  shod  ;  that  by  the  carelessness  of  his  servant,  in  performing  that  operation,  a  nail  had  been  driven  into  the  near  hind  foot,  after  which  inflammation  supervened,  and  the  horse  died  in  the  month  of  November.  Witnesses  having  been  called  to  prove  these  pacts,  Mr.  PETER  TAYLOR,  a  veterinary  surgeon,  was  called,  and  stated  :  In  the  early  part  of  June  last  he  attended  the  horse  belonging  to  the  plaintiff.  It  was  on  the  Monday.  He  found  the  shoe  off  the  near  hind  foot.  The  shoe  was  re  moved  on  the  Sunday.  The  horse  was  in  a  dreadful  state  of  agitation;  its  head  was  up  •  the  corner  ;  its  foot  was  much  swollen,  and  there  was  a  thickening  round  the  coronet  of  the  hoof.  A  portion  of  the  hoof  was  cut  away,  but  not  much,  because  there  was  so  much  inflammation.  About  a  quarter  of  an  inch  of  horn  was  removed.  The  horse  could  not  put  its  foot  down.  On  the  Wednesday  following  he  removed  a  poultice  which  he  had  ordered  to  be  put  on,  but  the  bone  was  then  in  a  most  irritable  state,  and  he  ordered  the  poul poultice  tice poultice  and  bathing  to  be  continued;  and  on  the  Friday  follow following.he  ing.he following.he  again  removed  the  poultice,  when  he  found  matter  oozing  .  out  of  the  coronet  or  upper  part  of  the  foot,  and  upon  removing  the  horny  part  of  the  hoof,  he  found  a  small  hole,  which  he  probed,  and  found  that  it  was  connected  with  the  coronet,  where  he  had  just  discovered  the  matter  oozing  out.  Hie  Hozcon  In  yutu  upiuion,  what  was  the  cause  of  that  discharge  taking  place  ?  Witness  :  I  have  no  doubt  but  that  it  was  caused  by  a  puncture  made  by  some  nail,  or  something  of  that  sort.  It  could  not  be  occasioned  by  a  bruise  or  a  crush.  It  must  have  been  occasioned  by  a  prick.  The  horse  was  in  such  a  state  that  it  could  scarcely  cat  or  drink.  He  attended  the  horse  for  a  week,  when  he  was  put  into  the  hands  of  the  defendant.  It  would  be  two  or  three  days  after  the  prick,  that  the  horse  would  begin  to  show  symptoms  of  lameness.  A  tread  would  not  produce  such  an  effect.  He  could  not  say  positively  that  the  death  of  the  horse  resulted  from  that  prick,  but  he  had  no  doubt  of  it.  He  did  not  see  the  horse  after  he  left  off  attending  it.  In  his  cross-examination  by  Mr.  Bretherton,  the  witness  said  it  would  be  impossible  for  the  horse  to  have  itself  caused  such  lameness  by  running  on  a  newly  macadamised  road,  as  the  shoe  would  have  protected  the  part  where  he  had  found  the  small  hole  which  he  had  described.  Pricking  a  horse  in  shoeing  was  purely  accidental,  and  was  frequently  done  by  the  most  experienced  smiths.  Other  witnesses  were  called  to  prove  the  value  of  the  horse,  and  also  to  show  that  the  horse  had  gradually  got  worse  and  worse  from  the  time  that  it  had  been  shod  by  the  ;  defendant,  until  it  died.  Mr.  BREMERTON,  for  the  defendant,  contended  that  there  was  no  evidence  given  that  the  death  of  the  horse  had  been  caused  by  the  negligence  and  carelessness  of  the  defendant  ;  and  referred  to  a  similar  case—(Collins  v.  Rowding,)—tried  before  Baron  Pollock,  in  1845,  to  substantiate  the  opinion  he  entertained  on  the  subject.  Supposing  that  the  horse  did  die  from  the  prick,  there  was  nothing  to  show  that  the  prick  was  occasioned  by  any  want  of  skill  or  negligence  of  the  defendant;  nor  was  there  any  evidence  called  to  prove  how  the  horse  had  died,  which  was  essential,  as  the  summons  stated  the  horse  did  languish  and  from  the  defen defendant's  dant's defendant's  neglect.  What  was  there  to  show  that  there  was  gross  neglect,  or  want  of  care  ?  The  evidence  being  thus  incomplete,  he  should  submit,  the  plaintiff  must  be  non nonsuited,  suited, nonsuited,  His  HONOR,  after  briefly  replying  to  Mr.  Bretherton,  upon  the  law  of  thelcase,  submitted  that  the  evidence  went  to  show  that  the  lameness  had  arose  from  the  pricking,  and  that  the  lameness  brought  on  death.  Mr.  BRETHERTON  having  at  some  length  detailed  the  de defence  fence defence  ho  should  make  to  the  action,  which  would  show  that  it  was  a  complete  conspiracy  against  his  client,  called  Mr.  JOHN  SANKEY  ,  who  stated  that  he  was  a  smith,  and  that  he  had  a  man  in  his  employ  by  the  name  of  Rowlands.  This  man  left  him  on  the  18th  of  June.  Ho  recollected  the  defendant  having  a  horse  called  Bobby  to  be  shod.  Rowlands  fitted  two  shoes,  and  Jack  knocked  two  of  the  shoes  on.  That  was  on  the  16th  of  June.  The  man  who  put  the  shoes  on  was  in  his  employ  for  seven  years,  and  was  capable  of  shoing  a  horse.  He  had  never  heard  any  complaints  against  him.  On  the  2d  of  July,  by  accident  he  called  at  the  defendant's  house  for  a  glass  of  ale,  when  he  said,  have  made  a  pretty  mess  of  my  horse,  either  you,  or  some  of  your  men  have  .pricked  him,  and  he  is  going  to  die  of  He  went  to  the  stable  and  saw  the  horse.  The  witness  then  detailed  What  he  had  prescribed  for  the  horse  from  the  2d  of  June  to  the  11th,  at  which  time  he  left  the  horse,  telling  the  plaintiff  to  take  care  of  him,  and  he  would  soon  be  all  right.  The  horse  had  been  at  the  smithy  twice,  and  he  had  left  the  near  hind  foot  quite  sound.  After  this  the  off  hind  foot  of  the  horse  became  diseased,  and  on  the  27th  of  July  the  defen defendant  dant defendant  attended  it,  but  none  of  his  instructions  were  followed  out,  and  on  the  3d  of  August  he  gave  up  the  job,  because  he  had  so  frequently  to  complain  of  the  inattention  of  the  plaintiff  in  not  doing  as  he  directed,  alleging,  as  an  excuse,  that  he  was  short  of  hands.  He  never  heard  of  the  horse  being  ill  from  the  27th  of  July  last  to  the  3d  of  August.  Mr.  EvANs,  veterinary  surgeon,  corroborated  the  evidence  of  the  last  witness,  as  far  as  attending  the  horse,  from  the  27th  of  July  to  the  3d  of  August,  during  which  time  they  had  to  complain  of  neglect  on  the  part  of  the  plaintiff  in  not  fulfilling  their  instructions  with  regard  to  the  horse.  Mani;  other  witnesses  were  cilia'  for  the  defence,  to  contradict  the  defendant's  statement,  and  for  the  purpose  of  proving  that  on  the  23rd  of  June,  the  day  on  which  it  was  alleged  by  the  plaintiff  that  the  horse  was  shod,  and  the  nail  driven  into  his  foot,  the  plaintiff's  son  took  the  horse  from  the  cart,  after  a  hard  day's  work,  and  ran  it  a  three  heat  race  over  a  newly  macadamised  road,  which  the  defen defendant  dant defendant  alleged  was  the  cause  of  injury  in  the  animal's  foot.  It  was  also  proved  that  the  animal  died  from  falling  into  a  ditch  in  such  a  manner  that  it  could  not  extricate  itself.  Mr.  GATEHEAD  replied  to  the  evidence  for  the  defence,  contending  that  the  plaintiff's  case  remained  uncontradicted  —namely  that  the  defendant  had  shod  the  horse  on  the  23rd  of  June,  when  the  animal  had  been  pricked,  .from  which  injury  it  died.  His  HONOR,  after  carefully  recapitulating  the  evidence,  in  the  course  of  which  he  censured  the  conduct  of  the  plaintiff,  in  which  he  had  shown  gross  neglect,  in  not  properly  attending  upon  the  horse,  held  that  the  farrier  was  liabl  e  for  the  damage  he  had  caused  in  not  having  the  horse  _  .  - STYLE=superscript  amply  s►tffirient.  to  corr  .
