"SHIP  WRIGHTS'  MEETING,  At  half-past  one  o'clock  yesterday,  the  operative  ship shipwrights  wrights shipwrights  of  Liverpool  held  a  public  meeting  in  the  Concert  hall,  Lord  Nelson-street,  for  the  purpose  of  rebutting  cer certain  tain certain  statements  made  by  the  ship-builders'  association  at  a  meeting  held  at  the  Graving-dock.  Regulation-office,  on  Wednesday  evening,  the  28th  inst  9  and  to  adopt  such  re resolutions  solutions resolutions  as  may  appear  to  them  The  hall  was  crowded  to  excess,  and  several  members  of;  the  masters'  association  were  present.  Some  confusion  oc occurred  curred occurred  on  the  entrance  of  Mr.  Fitzpatrick,  but  it  shortly  after  subsided  and  business  commenced.  On  the  motion  of  Mr.  Thomas  Shimners,  Mr.  EDWARD  GRATTAN  was  called  to  the  chair,  amidst  enthusiastic  applause.  The  CHAIRMAN  in  opening  the  business  of  the  meet meeting  ing meeting  referred  to  the  unusual  occurrence  of  the  trade  calling  a  meeting  in  this  hall,  and  much  more  so,  calling  it  in  the  day  time,  and  continued  to  say  :  —There  must  be  some  cause  for  it.  There  was  a  cause.  The  uninitiated  in  their  trade  would  say,  what  was  the  reason  for  this  ;  why  were  they  calling  a  meeting  at  this  hour  of  the  day  ?  If  there  was  any  person  there  not  connected  with  the  trade,  he  (the  Chairman  hoped  he  would  go  away  satisfied  that  there  was  a  cause,  and  that  cau  se  h  e  ex  p  ec  t  e  d  wou  ld  b  e  fully  explained  to  them  and  answered  in  the  course  of  the  afternoon.  (Hear,  hear.)  The  meeting  now  assembled  had  been  provoked  by  a  succession  of  meetings  on  the  part  of  their  employers,  the  last  of  all  being  held  on  last  Wed Wednesday,  nesday, Wednesday,  of  all  other  days,  in  the  Graving  Dock  Regulation  Office.  The  masters  held  a  meeting,  and  contrary  to  all  usage,  they  employed  a  reporter,  and  thus  had  been  sent  into  the  public  press  what  they  had  said  about  the  ship shipwrights  wrights shipwrights  of  Liverpool;  they  had  vilified  them  and  called  them  worse  than  probably  they  deserved  ;  but  he  hoped  they  would  shoW  to  the  public  of  Liverpool,  they  deserved  better  treatment  from  the  hands  of  men  who  had  sprung  from  their  own  ranks,  a  great  many  of  them.  (Applause.)  Let  them  remember  too,  that  this  was  an  age  of  progress,  and  an  age  of  science,  of  education  and  intelligence.  (Year,  hear.)  The  masters  could  not  now  say  to  a  man,  you  must  take  so  much  and  no  and  when  they  said  it  the  man  was  compelled  to  take  it.  (Hear,  hear.)  The  working  classes  now  knew  the  value  of  their  capital  as  well  as  any  capitalist  knew  the  value  of  his  capital.  (Hear,  hear.)  The  masters  could  not  now  tell  them  to  take  this  and  that,  and  they  took  it.  They  must  not  imagine  we  are  living  in  the  land  of  Austria  or  Russia.  No,  they  were  living  in  England.  (Cheers.)  The  masters  had  held  a  meeting,  they  had  called  in.  the  aid  of  reporters,  had  dragged  them  (the  operatives)  before  the  public  through  the  press,  and  they  had  now  got  the  same  privilege  for  themselves,  and  thankful  they  were  for  it.  (H  e  a  r  ,  h  ear  .)  Th  ey  had  got  that  privilege,  and  they  claimed  it  as  British  subjects.  (Cheers.)  He  told  the  masters,  each  and  every  one  of  them,  that  this  was  not  the  age  to  say  to  men  We  shall  give  you  a  certain  amount  of  and  the  men  must  submit,  or  must  lie  in  such  hovels  as  the  masters  might  choose  to  select  for  them,  in  any  part  of  the  town.  (Hear,  hear,)  A  man  naturally  suited  his  own  convenience,  and  if  it  suited  his  convenience  to  live  in  the  south  end  of  the  town  near  his  work,  why  should  it  be  said  they  ought  to  live  at  the  other  end  of  the  town,  to  suit  the  convenience  of  the  masters.  (A  voice  :  Mr.  Grayson  said  that.)  The  operative  shipwrights  of  Liverpool,  had  as  much  right  to  select  the  locality  of  their  residence  as  the  masters  had.  Capitalists  in  whatever  trade  they  were,  suited  their  own  convenience,  and  the  shipwrights  had  an  equal  right  to  do  the  same.  They  suited  their  own  convenience,  and  on  that  account  they  were  blamed.  They  had  been  tantalized  and  taxed  in  different  ways,  and  last  of  all  )hey  had  been  belied  in  another  way,  whilst  they  (the  shipwrights)  had  been  looking  to  the  grand  object  of  the  employers;  they  had  been  belied  in  another  way,  which  was  reported  in  the  Mercury,  and  which  had  been  almost  lost  sight  of.  It  was  under  the  head  and  he  was  proud  to  sayhe  was  in  a  position,  so  far  as  Mr.  Major's  men  went,  to  offer  it  a  flat  contradiction.  It  was  a  case  in  the  County  Court,  between  Mr.  Major,  and  one  of  his  blacksmiths.  He  would  state  the  facts  as  nearly  as  he  could.  There  were  black blacksmiths  smiths blacksmiths  employed  by  Mr.  Major,  a  little  time  ago,  who  were  not  members  of  the  shipsmith's  society.  That  was  nothing  to  him  (the  chairman,)  and  it  was  nothing  to  the  ship shipwright's  wright's shipwright's  association.  If  a  man  in  another  branch  of  business  connected  with  shipbuilding  did  not  choose  to  enrol  himself  in  the  society  belonging  to  that  branch,  they  did  no  t  inter interfere.  fere. interfere.  It  was  enough  for  their  society  to  manage  its  own  affairs.  This  man  went  and  represented  in  Court  that  if  Mr.  Major  had  not  turned  those  men  away,  the  shipwrights  would  have  struck  against  them.  He  (the  Chairman)  gave  that  assertion  a  flat  denial,  Being  at  present  in  the  employ  of  Mr.  Major,  he  should  know  the  sentiments  and  opinions  of  the  fifty  men  whom  he  employed,  and  they  never  knew  anything  about  those  men,  or  who  or  what  they  were  ;  nor  did  they  know  there  was  a  misunderstanding  between  Mr.  Major  and  the  smiths,  until  they  saw  the  blacksmith's  shop  shut,  and  then  they  heard  it,  but  heard  no  more  about  it  until  they  saw  the  paper.  He  merely  stated  this  that  it  might  be  as  publicly  denied  as  it  was  publicly  stated.  (Ap (Applause.)  plause.) (Applause.)  Mr.  Nom,  Secretary  of  the  Shipwright's  Association,  next  came  forward  to  address  the  meeting.  He  said  they  had  been  represented  by  a  certain  portion  of  the  press,  as  exacting  an  extraordinary  rate  of  payment  from  their  masters,  and  he  wished  to  enquire  whether  that  statement  was  caused  by  them  or  by  their  employers.—(Some  inter interruption  ruption interruption  here  took  place  in  the  body  of  the  hall,  caused  by  a  drunken  man,  who  it  was  stated  was  not  a  shipwright,  but  a  publican  named  Stokes.  Order  was  secured  by  his  re removal.)  moval.) removal.)  lie  would  commence  by  taking  a  review  of  the  trade  within  the  last  twenty  months.  A  great  chancre  had  come  •  over  the  trade  in  consequence  of  the  great  demand  for  shipping  caused  by  the  emigration  to  Australia.  This,  in  a  great  measure,  had  made  their  trade  more  prosperous  than  it  had  been  known  for  a  considerable  number  of  years.  In  the  month  of  January,  1852,  not  two  years  ago,  he  made  it  his  business  then,  on  a  particular  day,  to  make  enquiries  as  to  the  number  of  men  he  could  ascertain  was  employed  in  the  whole  of  the  building  yards  and  ships  in  the  port  of  Liver Liverpool.  pool. Liverpool.  If  his  calculations  served  him  rightly,  he  believed  the  number  of  men  employed  in  January,  1852,  on  one  particu:  lar  day,  was  110,  out  of  a  majority  bordering  nearly  on  1,600,  and  he  might  say  1,400  (leaving  out  100  who  might  be  sick  or  at  sea)  were  out  of  employment.  He  foUnd  also,  amongst  other  things,  the  tonnage  of  the  shipping  en entering  tering entering  the  graving  docks  was  considerably  greater  than  it  had  been  in  former  years,  and  yet  there  was  no  greater  em employment  ployment employment  given  to  the  men,  although  the  tonnage  had  become  double  or  treble  what  it  was.  At  the  commence commencement  ment commencement  of  1852,  the  amount  of  employment  was  not  probably  greater  than  it  was  in  1846,  and  yet  a  person  looking  at  the  tonnage  inwards  and  outwards,  would  say  the  shipwrights  of  Liverpool  must  be  in  a  very  flourishing  condition,  for  here  we  find,  by  the  returns  of  the  dock  committee,  the  tonnage  '  was  so  much  in  1846,  and  in  1852  it  is  three  times  as  much,  and  they  must  have  prospered  in  proportion  to  the  Such  was  not  the  fact.  Trade  progressed,  but  we  remained  stationary—Why  ?  Because  the  masters  had  '  got  entangled  in  such  a  system  of  slopping  ships  (Cheers,  and  cries  of  Where  one  man  was  re required  quired required  to  do  a  certain  amount  of  work,  which  he  could  do  well  in  1846,  in  1862  he  was  compelled  to  keep  pace  with  the  times  and  do  four  times  that  quantity,  and  consequently  they  could  not  not  do  it  so  well.  (Hear,  hear.)  A  remedy  must  be  provided  for  that—the  elections  came  on,  and  amongst  other  things  a  statement  was  issued  that  trade  was  progressive,  .  and  that  the  shipwrights  must  go  along  with  the,  trade.  Ile  (Mr.  Neal)  and  others  thought  something  was  wrong,  and  that  some  remedy  ought  to  be  provided.  What  remedy  ought  they  to  provide  ?  It  was  this.  They  could  do  what  they  had  done  previously  in  a  good  and  work workmanlike  manlike workmanlike  manner.  They  could  get  up  work  at  least  in  good  condition  ;  but  then  it  was  done  very  different,  and  in  some  cases  it  was  don  6  in  a  very  shameful  and  scandalous  manner.  The  consequence  was  the  trade  took  a  sudden  change.  'Where  there  was  one  man  employed  on  a  ship  in  consequence  of  the  determination  on  the  part  of  their  trade,  to  do  justice  to  the  shipping  interest  of  the  port,  double  the  quantity  of  men  was  put  on,  and  he  had  no  hesitation  in  saying  that  the  masters  who  had  entered  into  contracts  pre previous  vious previous  to  the  limitation  system,  as  it  was  termed,  being  adopted  by  the  shipwrights'  association,  offered  as  much  as  £56  to  foiego  their  - STYLE=superscript  contracts—why  so  ?,  Because  they  took  them  under  the  express  condition  Of  slopping  the  work,  and  when  they  knew  the  men  would  do  the  work  properly,  they  knew  they  would  be  out  of  pocket,  and  they  preferred  to  throw  the  contracts  overrboard.  (Loud  cheers.)  Well,  this  was  dangerous  ground  for  the  masters  to  attack  them  npon.  They  said,  or  probably  they  might  have  thought,  if  they  attacked  the  men  for  doing  work  properly,  they  would  not  have  public  opinion  with  them  '  •  they  could  not  force  the  men  ;  but  they  must  undermine  them,  and  endeavour  to  get  up  fresh  rules,  and  cause  a  dispute  by  some  means,  on  some  cause  or  other  rather  than  the  real  one  at  issue.  (Neer,  hear.)  They  turned  to  and  produced  a  fresh  lot  of  rules  in  1862,  in  which  their  darling  principle  was  to  be  perpetrated  t  to  get  out  as  many  apprentices  as  they  could.  A  two-handed  job  was  to  be  done  by  a  single  man  and  a  single  lad  working  together,  and  this  would  in  slack  times  be  turned  to  a  very  serious  ac account  count account  against  them  ;  for  every  job  that  could  be  put  off  from  having  four  hands,  would  be  turned  into  a  two  handed  job,  and  the  consequence  was  the  masters  would  have  three-fourths  of  the  benefit,  and  the  men  the  fourth  only.  They  insisted  that  the  rules'time  out  of  mind  had  been  'one  appr  i STYLE=superscript  entice  to  every  three  men  employed  in  out  door  work  ;  to  this  regu regulation  lation regulation  the  men  belonging  to  the  trade  were  bound  to  adhere.  There  were  certain  other  conditions  put  in,  but  it  was  well  known  to  the  trade,  that  the  only  thing  the  masters  wanted  to  abolish  was  the  limitation,  and  they  cared  little  for  anything  else.  The  shipwrights  were  determined  to  do  a  fair  day's  work,  so  far  as  caulking  was  concerned,  because,  of  all  descriptions  of  shipwrights'  work,  it  did  not  show  whether  it  was  slopped  or  not.  (Hear,  hear.)  If  one  piece  of  timber  was  to  be  fitted  in  to  another  it  spoke  for  itself,  and  any  man  could  see  whether  it  was  properly  done;  but  caulking  was  covered  over  with  sheathing,  and  it  did  not  tell  for  itself.  It  was  like  a  man  with  a  good  coat  and  a  dirty  shirt  inside  it  ;  it  could  not  be  seen,  and  no  person  could  tell  whether  it  was  dirty  or  not.  (Hear,  hear,  and  laughter.)  They  threatened  all  sorts  of  annoyance  ;  they  said  we  would  stop  the  trade  of  the  port,  and  that  Liverpool  was  to  be  ruined.  (No  ;  not  yet.)  However,  it  was  finally  agreed,  that  on  a  certain  day  in  August,  the  new'  regulations  adopted  by  the  masters,  were  to  come  in  force  on  the  13th  of  August.  Well,  on  the  12th  of  August,  the  night  previous  to  those  celebrated  rules  coming  into  force,  the  masters  re-considered  the  steps  taken,  and  they  sent  him  word,  if  there  was  no  probability  of  the  men  agreeing  to  the  proposed  rules,  they  had  better  refer  them  to  arbitration.  This  was  agreed  to.  They  referred  tk  them  to  four  gentlemen,  extensive  shipowners  ,  „  iOl  Liverpool,  and  they  agreed  to  abide  by  the  tahet',  to  ;  and  he  had  the  c  ommo  n  honesty,  when••  :ince!  strangers  came  before  th  e  ar  bitrators,  he  d!  .  they  would  not  arbitrate  at  all  on  that'  not  care  whether  they  had  it  or  not,  and  6) STYLE=superscript  0  40  they  were  justified  in  not  admitting  it  am  code  of  rules.  Some  three  months  wereis  from  the  time  the  a  r  bit  ra  t  ors  sa  t  till  they  sent  in  des  but  amongst  other  things  they  struck  at  they  wanted  two  apprentices  to  every  journe7the  were  satisfied  if  the  arbitr  a  t  ors  wer  e.
