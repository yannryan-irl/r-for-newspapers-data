"FROM  THE  CIRCULAR  OF  MESSRS.  CUNNINGHAM  AND  HINSHAW.  In  the  review  we  propose  to  make  of  the  details  of  the  annexed  Tables,  and  of  the  circumstances  by  which  the  Trade  of  the  past  year  has  been  most  influenced,  the  first  consi consideration  deration consideration  suggested  is  as  to  the  amount  of  the  supplies  which  have  been  received,  and  in  reference  to  these  the  Import  of  American  Cotton  primarily  claims  attention.  The  American  Crop  of  last  year  exceeded,  according  to  the  authorised  tables  published  on  the  31st  August,  that  of  any  former  year  by  247,853  Bales,  the  aggregate  yield  amounting  so  no  ices  3,262,882  Bales.  Of  this  quantityl,736,B6o  Bales,  or  an  excess  of  68,111  Bales  over  the  supply  of  any  former  year,  were  allotted  to  us  ;  owing,  however,  to  the  liberality  of  the  shipments  during  the  concluding  four  months  of  last  year  (359.756  Bales  against  165,297  this  year),  the  actual  import  of  the  present  year  has  fallen  short  of  that  of  1852  by  257,157  Bales,  being  1,533,542  Bales  against  1,790,699  last  year;  a  fact  which,  together  with  the  unusually  large  proportion  of  low  inferior  Cotton  comprised  in  the  supply,  and  which  is  partly  attributable  to  the  ungenial  character  of  the  earlier  motatims  of  the  growing  season,  and  partly  perhaps  to  an  insufficiency  of  the  labour  requisite  to  secure  in  good  condition  a  late  though  large  crop,  has  for  a  long  time  past  operated  powerfully  on  the  scale  of  prices,  depressing  the  lower  and  raising  the  higher  classes  in  unusual  and  disproportionate  degree.  The  general  distribution  of  the  American  Crop  was  as  follows,  viz.  :-to  Great  Britain  1,736,860  Bales,  to  France  426  728  Bales,  and  to  other  Foreign  parts  364,812  Bales,  leaving  671,000  Bales  for  the  Home  Consumption  of  the  States  and  127,000  Bales  in  Stock  at  the  Shipping  Ports,  Of  Brazil  the  supply  has  notmaterially  differed  from  that  of  last  year,  being  132,443  Bales,  against  144,209  last  year.  From  Egypt  there  has  been  a  material  falling  off,  the  import  being  105,474  Bales  against  189,245  last  year;  it  must  however  be  borne  in  mind  that  owing  to  the  low  comparative  prices  which  prevailed  for  this  description  throughout  the  greater  part  of  1830  and  1851  a  large  proportion  of  the  craps  of  those  years  was  kept  back,  and  under  the  influence  of  time  high  prices  of  last  year  was  then  freely  shipped.  Of  Surat  the  supply  has  been  large  beyond  all  precedent,  the  growth  having  been  abundant,  and  the  prices  ruling  here,  at  least  until  lately,  tempting,  and  the  revolutionary  state  of  China  having  checked  shipments  to  that  country  :  the  amount  received  has  been  485,527  Bales,  or  an  excess  of  159,053  Bales  over  the  supply  of  any  former  year-last  year  222,404  Bales=  were  received.  The  Import  of  all  descriptions  into  the  Kingdom,  it  will  be  seen,  amounts  to  2,264,711  Bales,  against  2,357,718  last  year.  As  , STYLE=superscript  regards  the  supply  of  the  ensuing  year  we  are  quite  prepared,  should  the  course  of  trade  not  bo  interfered  with  by  Continental  politica,  to  anticipate  an  excess,  and  possibly  not  an  inconsiderible  one,  over  that  of  the  past  year,  for  though  the  extent  of  the  American  Crop  may  not  quite  equal  last  year's,  it  must  be  remembered  that  the  exports  of  the  growth  have  so  far  fallen  short  of  , STYLE=superscript  that  of  1852  by  204,4Z49  Bales,  and  that  this  quantity,  or  at  least  an  amount  in  fair  proportion  to  the  yield,  has  yet  to  be  received  ;  and  further  it  cannot  but  be  regarded  as  probable  that  the  shipments  of  the  next  crop  will  be  during  concluding  months  of  the  ensuing  year  on  a  more  liberal  scale  than  those  of  the  last.  From  Brazil  and  Egypt  we  see  no  reason  to  anticipate  under  ordinary  circumstances  of  trade  as  falling  off  in  the  supplies;  whilst  from  India,  should  the  present  revolutionary  state  of  China  continue--and  we  fear  the  movement  is  of  too  gigantic  a  character  to  admit  of  a  speedy  settle settlement-and  ment-and settlement-and  should  the  prices  ruling  here  not  be  unduly  low,  the  import  will  doubtless  again  be  very  large.  The  EXPORTS  of  the  past  year  amount  to  349,600  Bales  ae.tinst  282,800  Bales  in  1852.  The  cames  consists  of  10,000  American,  6,000  Brazil  and  Egyptian  and  50,000  Surats.  The  SPICCITLATtoN  of  the  year  in  this  market  has  been  on  a  comparatively  moderate  scale,  operations  of  this  kind  having  in  the  early  part  of  the  year  been  checked  by  apprehensions  suggested  by  the  large  estimates  current  of  the  American  crop,  and  latterly  by  the  threatening  aspect  of  Continental  politics,  as  well  also  as  by  the  high  point  at  which  prices,  notwithstandin  g  these  circumstances,  have  been  maintained.  The  amount  turned  over  has  been  412,940  Bales  a  g  ainst  830,650  last  year.  The  CoarstratmoN  of  the  past  year  appears  by  the  annexed  tables  to  have  been  1,855,051  Bales,  or  35,670  per  week,  against  1,911,998  Bales  last  year,  or  36,770  per  week.  It  i  s,  however,  highly  probable  that  the  actual  Consumption  of  the  year  has  exceeded  the  amount  of  our  tabular  statement  by  at  least  1,000  Bales  per  week,  inasmuch  as  Manufacturers,  influenced  by  the  troubled  aspect  of  Continental  politics,  by  the  unsettled,  dissatisfied  state  of  the  Operatives,  an  d  by  the  g  reatly  enhanced  value  of  Money  and  Corn,  allowed  their  Stocks  some  three  or  f  our  months  ago  to  run  down  to  the  smallest  possible  point,  and  have  since  bought  only  in  supply  of  their  immediate  wants.  If  therefore  we  are  correct  in  this  respect,  and  the  Trade  hold  consequently  fully  50,000  Bales  less  than  last  year,  and  we  think  the  fact  is  scarcely  open  to  question,  the  actual  Consumption  of  the  year  way  be  fixed  at  37,000  Bales  per  week.  But  large  as  this  estimate  is,  it  nevertheless  falls  short  of  the  Manufacturing  power  of  the  country  by  at  least  2,000  Bales  per  week,  since  the  various  strikes  of  Preston,  Wigan  and  other  places,  which  have  now  for  the  most  part  lasted  upwards  of  three  months,  and  the  short  time  which  has  of  late  been  worked  in  other  important  districts,  cannot  be  considered  to  involve  a  diminished  Consumption  of  less  than  100,000  Bales  ;  and  in  justification  of  this  estimate  of  the  Manufacturing  power  of  the  country  it  may  also  be  a  dded  that  the  production  of  the  coarser  qualities  of  Goods  and  Yarns  was  mate materially  rially materially  checked  during  the  first  six  or  eight  months  of  the  year  by  the  comparatively  high  prices  which  prevailed  for  the  raw  material.  The  following  are  the  details  of  the  deliveries  from  the  Ports  for  Cousumption  as  compared  with  last  year,  viz:-  American.  Brasil.  Egyptian.  Surat.  Other  kinds.

This  discrepancy,  though  an  important  ono,  will  yet,  in  the  present  unsatisfactory  position  of  the  Market  as  regards  supply,  probably  exercise  no  particular  influence  upon  prices.  The  total  amount  held  here  is  697,6  00 STYLE=superscript  Bales  against  677,810  last  year;  and  the  aggregate  of  all  the  Ports  is  717,680  Bales  against  657,520  Bales  last  year.  In  American  descriptions  there  Is  a  deficiency  as  compared  with  last  year  of  51,900  Bales,  in  Brazil  of  5,470,  in  Egyptian  of  17,650,  and  in  various  kinds  of  2,360  Bales,  whilst  in  Surat  there  is  an  excess  of  137,440  Bales.  This  amount  of  Stocks  cannot  but  be  considered  as  exceedingly  moderate  when  it  is  remembered,  that  whilst  the  Manufacturing  power  of  the  country  is  greatly  increased,  the  Trade  hold  less  as  already  stated  by  at  least  50,000  Bales  than  at  the  close  of  last  year,  and  that  of  the  Stock  of  American  held  by  Importers  fully  three-fourths  consists  of  low  and  inferior  Cotton  ranging  from  31d.  to  61d.  per  lb.,  and  which  is  relatively  even  yet  in  but  limited  demand.  Had  Consumption  therefore  not  been  checked  by  the  peculiar  combination  of  circumstances  which  have  operated  so  especially  against  trade  during  the  last  four  mouths,  and  to  which  allusion  has  already  been  made,  it  is  clear  that  the  paucity  of  supplies  would  have  forced  up  prices  to  a  point  much  above  the  rates  which  are  now  current.  Pt:atm.-That  the  fluctuation  in  prices,  at  least  in  the  prices  of  all  those  descriptions  which  have  been  in  the  most  current  consumption,  should  have  been  during  the  past  year  more  than  usua  lly  limited,  considering  the  magnitude  and  fearful  portent  of  the  events  by  which  it  has  been  signalized,  viz.  by  the  long  threatened  and  final  disruption  of  the  peace  of  Europe,  the  w  id  e  spread  agitation  of  the  Labour  Question,  the  immense  rise  which  has  taken  place  in  the  value  of  Money  and  Corn,  from  435.  to  735.  per  quarter  in  the  one  and  from  2  to  5  per  cent  in  the  other,  cannot  but  be  regarded  as  most  remarkable  and  as  suggestive  of  much  anxiety  for  the  future.  Still  the  apparent  anomaly  of  the  fact  is  not  difficult  of  solution,  for  with  Middling  Orleans  ruling  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  at  the  m  e  dium  point  o  f  s:td.  per  lb.,  with  Trade  good  in  Manchester  and  the  Stocks  of  Goods  and  Yarns  light,  :there  was  on  the  one  hand  but  little  room  for  depression,  whilst  on  the  other  no  material  rise  was  justifiable  in  the  face  of  time  large  estimates  of  the  American  Crop  which  were  then  current.  Under  the  influence  therefore  of  these  opposing  elements,  the  fluctuations  which  were  experienced  in  the  value  of  Middling  Orleans  (the  fairest  test  at  all  times  of  the  course  of  the  market,)  during  the  first  eight  months  of  the  year  did  not  exceed  id.  per  lb.,  the  price  never  falling  below  50.  or  rising  above  61d.  per  lb.,  and  ruling  during  this  period  for  the  most  part  at  50.  to  6d.  At  the  beginning  of  August  their  extreme  value  was  bid.  per  IL,  but  from  this  point,  owing  to  the  increasing  complication  of  the  eastern  Question,  and  to  the  strong  and  general  manifestation  of  dissatisfaction  amongst  the  Operatives,  they  gradually  declined  till  t  h  e  c  l  ose  o  f  S  e  pt  em  ber,  when  their  most  current  value  was  that  ruling  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,  viz.,  61d.  per  lb.,  although  partially  business  was  at  this  time  done  at  rather  lower  rates,  Th  ee  however  speedily  recovered  from  this  depression,  time  supply  of  all  qualities  above  good  ordinary  having  become  relatively  very  small,  and  during  the  last  two  months  they  have  again  ruled  for  the  most  part  at  6d.  per  lb.  Whilst  such  have  been  the  alternations  in  the  value  o  f  th  e  m  e  di  u  m  qualities  of  American,  it  must  however  he  observed  that  the  prices  of  the  higher  and  lower  classes,  the  former  of  which  have  abased  throughout  the  year  beens  i  relatively  very  scarce  an  d  th  e  l  atter  very  a  b  un  d  an  t,  h  a  y,  gra  d  ua  lly  become  separated  by  a  wider  scale,  so  that  the  rates  now  ruling  for  th  e  one  ,  were  th  e  new  import  not  close  upon  us,  would  greatly  enhance  the  consumption  of  Brazil,  whilst  those  of  the  other  are  strongly  felt  in  forcing  down  time  price  of  Surat,  and  in  thus  encou encouraging  raging encouraging  greatly  time  production  of  coarse  Goods  and  Yarns,  which,  as  we  have  already  noticed,  was  materially  checked  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  by  the  comparatively  high  prices  then  ruling.  Th  e  p  r  i  ces  of  a  ll  th  e  c  urrent  qualities  of  Brazil  and  Egyptian  were  pretty  much  the  same  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  as  they  now  are,  but  at  the  highest  point,  viz.,  in  September,  both  d  escr  i  pt  i  ons  commanded  higher  rates  by  id.  to  Id.  per  lb.  than  those  now  ruling,  and  the  finer  classes  of  the  latter,  which  were  freely  taken  in  the  middle  of  the  yearas  a  substitute  for  Sea  Islands  then  brought  prices  2d.  to  3d.  per  lb.  above  present  rates.  Surats  followed  closely  the  course  of  the  American  Market  during  the  first  six  or  seven  months  of  the  year,  but  the  gradual  accumulation  of  the  stocks  of  both  them  and  common  American  has  since  influenced  for  the  most  part  a  slow  but  steady  decline,  the  prices  now  ruling  being  about  id.  per  lb.  below  those  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  Although  the  year  opened  with  high  prices  for  Sea  Islands  they  yet  steadily  advanced,  under  the  stimulus  of  great  consumption  and  an  impression  which  very  generally  prevailed  that  the  supply  would  be  deficient,  till  the  close  of  August,  when  an  improvement  of  3d.  per  lb.  for  all  the  current  qualities  and  4d.  to  Bd.  for  the  finer  grades  was  readily  obtainable.  During  the  last  two  or  three  months  however  opinion  has  been  against  them,  the  supply,  in  consequence  of  the  heavy  operations  of  Consumers  in  the  early  part  of  the  year,  having  been  found  abundant,  and  favourable  reports  having  on  the  whole  been  received  of  the  growth  of  time  past  season.  Prices  during  this  period  have  therefore  seriously  declined  and  now  rule  in  all  the  lower  and  medium  qualities  4d.  to  sd.  per  lb.  below  those  current  at  the  close  of  last  year  ;  the  better  classes  however  have  not  declined  in  equal  degree  and  for  them  the  rates  ruling  are  about  2d.  per  lb.  lower,  whilst  for  fine  Cotton  there  are  still  4d.  to  6d.  higher  than  those  at  the  close  of  last  year.  The  enormous  magnitude  of  time  Cotton  Trade  and  its  great  susceptibility  to  time  influence  of  every  pecuniary  and  political  change,  renders  it  at  all  times  as  difficult  to  predict  the  amount  of  consumption,  or  the  scale  of  prices,  as  to  prognosticate  the  value  of  Money  or  the  price  of  Consols  ;  and  at  present,  looking  at  the  complicated  aspect  of  European  politics,  and  at  the  contest  which  is  being  carried  on  between  the  Operatives  and  their  Employers,  it  must,  by  common  consent,  be  admitted  that  time  future  is  more  than  usually  dark.  Still  if  due  consideration  be  given  to  t  h  e  vas  t  c  h  an  ges,  both  social  and  commercial  , STYLE=superscript  which  the  Gold  discoveries  of  California  and  New  South  Wales  are  working  over  the  whole  Trading  World-and  if  an  equitable  regard  be  h  a  d  a  l  so  to  the  foregoing  analysis  of  the  Statistics  of  the  past  year,  and  if  it  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  only  increase  of  supply  which  we  can,  with  any  surety,  rely  upon,  is  from  America,  and  that  this,  judg judging  ing judging  fr  o  m  t  h  e  accou  nts  which  have  hitherto  been  received  of  the  extent  and  character  of  the  Crop,  cannot  be  otherwise  than  of  moderate  amount,  and  for  the  most  part  of  low  and  inferior  q  ua  li  ty  if,  we  repeat,  all  these  things  be  dimly  considered,  it  is  quite  obvious  that  we  cannot  expect,  under  circumstances  which  may  afford  a  fair  reasonable  scope  to  the  Manufacturing  power  of  the  country,  a  lower  average  of  prices  than  that  of  the  past  year.  •  LIVERPOOL  MARKETS.—YESTERDAY.

Some  farther  business  has  been  done  in  Arracan  Rice,  at  a  small  advance,  upwards  of  3,000  bags  having  changed  hands  on  the  spot,  at  14s  to  cwt.
