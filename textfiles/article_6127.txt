A  sailor  on  board  a  coasting-vessel  was  found  .strangled  in  the  position  thus  described  by  a  shipmate  :—I  'got  a  light,  and  saw  two  boards,  forming  part  of  the  fore forecastle  castle forecastle  floor,  turned  up  on  edge.  I  looked  down,  and  saw  deceased  clinging  to  the  forehooks;  his  feet  upon  the  lower,  land  his  hand  upon  the  upper  one.  I  spoke  to  him,  but  he  'made  no  answer.  I  got  down  to  him  with  the  light,  and  lifted  his  shirt  off  the  nail,  and  said,  He  gave  a  groan.  He  was  hanging  by  his  arm-pits.  I  think  he  must  have  fallen,  and  the  spike-nail  caught  his  shirt  :  his  chin  was  resting  on  his  hands.  There  is  a  mark  on  his  breast.  The  shirt  was  pressing  on  the  side  of  Ins  neck.  On  the  jugular  vein  there  is  a  livid  mark.  gait  01?  iturtiort.
