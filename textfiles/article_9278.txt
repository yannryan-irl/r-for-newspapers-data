It  will  be  recollected  that  the  adjournment  took  place  on  Friday  last,  immediately  after  the  close  of  the  medical  evidence  proving:the  cause  of  the  death,  in  order  to  have  the  prisoner  present  before  the  coroner's  jury  for  the  purpose  of  identification,  as  the  Coroner  stated  that,  without  such  appearance,  he  con considered  sidered considered  the  inquiry  would  be  only  a  mockery  ;  and  he  had  written  on  the  preVieus  day  to  the  Secretary  of  State  upon  the  point,  but  had  received  no  answer  to  the  application.  Mr.  Wakley  said,  that  he  had  had  a  communication  with  the  Secretary  of  State  since  the  last  sitting,  which  resulted  in  a  personal  interview  ;  and  the  arrangement  was  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  not  the  slightest  objection  to  order  the  production  of  the  prisoner  before  the  coroner's  jury,  but  there  was  some  legal  difficulty  at  present  in  the  way,  and  he  regretted  that  he  should  have  to  adjourn  the  inquest  again  until  :Wednesday  morning  next  at  ten  o'clock,  when  the  person  mentioned  by  the  .witnesses  as  having  fired  the  shot  at  Mr.  Waugh  would  be  present  from  the  House  of  Detention.

The  Coroner  told  Mr.  Lewis  that  the  statement  must  be  reserved  for  the  next  sitting,  as  the  proceedings  were  now  adjourned  until STYLE=superscript  Wednesday  morning.  The  proceedings  then  terminated.  A  SECOND  ALICE  On  the  29th  December  last  (says  the  Bristol  Mercury)  a  robbery  was  committed  at  Lambessow  Farm,  near  Truro,  Cornwall,  occupied  by  a  person  named  Thomas  Williams.  During  the  morning  a  servant  girl,  named  Jane  Allen,  had  placed  four  petticoats,  81  yards  of  calico,  a  chemise,  and  a  piece  of  Irish  linnen  to  dry  on  a  hedge  adjoining  the  farm  yard.  She  occasionally  went  out  to  look  after  the  articles,  and  between  eleven  and  twelve  o'clock  she  informed  her  mistress,  that  on  going  to  the  hedge  to  look  after  them,  she  found  that  they  were  stolen,  and  she  also  stated  that  she  ha  l  seen  a  man  looking  over  the  hedge  into  the  field  where  they  were  drying.  Mr.  Williams  and  the  servants  immediately  proceeded  in  different  directions,  and  on  meeting  a  person  called  Edward  Williams  Drew,  the  son  of  Mr.  Drew,  innkeeper,  of  St.  Clement  Church  Town,  he  informed  them  that  he  had  seen  a  man  jump  over  the  hedge  with  a  bag  on  his  hack.  Info7mation  was  given  to  Mr.  Nash,  superinten superintendent  dent superintendent  of  police,  Truro,  with  a  description  of  the  man,  when  William  Conk,  a  collector  of  marine  stores,  was  appre apprehended,  hended, apprehended,  that  same  night,  about  twelve  o'clock,  at  a  com common  mon common  lodging  house,  and  immediately  identified  by  Drew.

On  being  taken  before  Dr.  Carlyon,  county  magistrate,  ho  was  committed  to  take  his  trial  at  the  last  quarter  sessions,  when  he  was  found  guilty  and  sentenced  to  six  months'  hard  labour.  On  Friday  last,  the  11th  inst..  the  same  servant,  Jane  Allen,  again  placed  a  number  of  articles,  consisting  of  three  bed-sheets,  two  chemises,  three STYLE=superscript  pairs  of  drawers,  three  caps,  three  collars,  and  a  habit  shirt,  on  the  hedge  to  dry,  and  about  mid  day  she  informed  her  mis mistress  tress mistress  that  the  articles  which  she  had  placed  on  the  hedge  were  stolen.  Mr.  Williams,  his  son,  and  several  of  the  farm  servants  scoured  the  neighbourhood,  but  could  find  no  one  who  was  likely  to  have  committed  the  theft.  Subse Subsequent  quent Subsequent  inquiries  caused  suspicion  to  fall  on  Jane  Allen  her herself,  self, herself,  and  at  last  some  of  the  calico  stolen  on  the  29th  ult.  was  traced  to  the  possession  of  a  young  woman  named  Amelia  Williams,  who  proved  that  Allen  had  brought  it  to  her  to  make  into  chemises.  Superintendent  Nash,  of  the  Truro  police,  then  took  Allen  into  custody,  and  charged  her  with  the  theft.  In  the  course  of  the  evening  she  stated  that  those  were  the  articles  ;which  Cook  had  been  convicted  of  stealinc,  and  that  she  had  taken  them  herself.  On  being  asked  what  had  become  of  the  articles  s'ae  had  taken  the  day  before,  she  said  they  were  buried  near  the  quarry.  11Ir.  Nash  on  going,  in  company  with  Police-constable  Woolcock,  one  of  the  detectives,  to  a  cartshed  near  the  quarry,  found  underneath  a  quantity  of  loose  straw,  the  property  stolen  the  previous  day;  and  about  eleven  o'clock  the  same  night  they  found,  on  a  wall  adjoining  the  field,  four  petticoats  and  a  chemise,  which  were  hid  behind  the  ivy  which  had  overgrown  the  wall_  those  articles  were  the  remainder  of  the  property  stolen  on  the  29th  ult.  The  prisoner  was  taken  before  Dr.  Carlyon,  who  committed  her  to  take  her  trial  at  the  next  assizes.  Dr.  Carlyon  has  taken  the  necessary  steps  for  the  remission  of  Cook's  sentence.  Great  praise  is  due  to  the  superintendent  for  the  very  able  Inanglez  in  which  h  e  traced  the  rel?Per7  t  9  the  re4l  9gelacler,;"
