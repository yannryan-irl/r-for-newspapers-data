TIIE  REPRESENTATION  OF  EDINBURGH.—The  requisition  of  the  electors  of  Edinburgh  to  Mr.  Adam  Black  has  already  been  so  numerously  signed  as  to  ensure  the  return  of  that  gentleman  in  the  room  of  the  Right  Hon.  T.  B.  Macaulay.  THE  OPENING  OF  PARLIAMENT.—Her  Majesty  has  signi signified  fied signified  her  gracious  intention  of  opening  the  session  of  Par Parliament  liament Parliament  in  person.  We  have  reason  to  believe  that  the  address  in  the  Lords,  in  reply  to  Her  Majesty's  speech  from  the  throne,  will  be  moved  by  the  Earl  of  Gosford,  and  seconded  by  the  Earl  of  Abingdon.  CORN  TRADE  IVITH  RUSSIA.  -  The  Dublin  Mercantile  Advertiser  states,  that  a  first-rate  corn  firm  in  that  city  is  now  receiving  orders  for  the  house  of  Brandt  &amp;  Co.,  of  St.  Petersburg,  for  wheat  to  be  delivered,  f.0.b.,  on  the  Neva,  at  from  18s  to  21s  per  quarter,  which,  allowing  for  freight  and  insurance,  would  make  the  cost  in  an  Irish  port  equal  to  about  19s  per  barrel.  HE  RUGELEY  POISONING  CASES.—The  Standard,  of  last  night,  publishes  the  following  observations  :  Another  verdict  of  a  coroner's  jury,  finding  William  Palmer  guilty  of  the  murder  of  Walter  Palmer,  was  delivered  on  Wednesday.  It  is  generally  understood  that  the  legal  adviser's  of  the  accused  intend  to  remove  the  several  inquests  upon  which  he  is  accused,  as  well  as  any  indictment  that  may  be  found  at  the  assizes,  into  the  Court  of  Queen's  Bench  by  certiorari.  That  supreme  tribunal  in  criminal  cases  may  try  him  at  their  own  bar,  in  full  court  ;  or  may,  by  changing  the  venue,  send  him  for  trial  to  any  English  cowry,  to  be  tried  by  a  jury  of  that  county.  This  is  a  wise  and  humane  provision  of  our  law,  for  it  is  scarcely  possible  to  suppose  that  the  unhappy  man,  either  as  innocent  or  guilty,  could  have  such  a  trial  as  every  accused  man  ought  to  have  in  the  locality  still  agitated  by  the  atrocious  crimes  with  which  he  is  charged.'  The  Times  suggests  that  the  trial  ought  to  take  before  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  Campbell  or  Chief  Justice  Jervis.  Why  are  the  Lord  Chief  Baron  and  the  whole  bench  of  puisne  judges  thus  put  aside  by  the  authorities  of  Printing-house  Square  ?  We  are  of  those  who  long  since  have  been  of  opinion  that  the  head  of  the  court  is  not  perhaps  the  best  lawyer,  and  who  also  think  that  a  puisne  judge,  who  owes  his  position  and  elevation  to  merit  and  acquirement,  is  a  better  administrator  of  justice  than  the  individual,  however  distinguished,  who  owes  his  pro promotion  motion promotion  to:political  influence,  or  partisan  zeal.  Time  has  proved  that  our  most  perfect  Judges  are  those  who  never  wore  a  silk  gown  or  held  a  seat  in  Parliament.  FAILURE  AT  MANCHESTFR.—The  Manchester  firm  to  to  which  we  [yesterday  alluded  to  as  having  suspended  their  payments  is  that  of  Messrs.  Kelly  and  Gilmour,  spinners  and  manufacturers.  Their  liabilities  are  reported  to  be  about  L  120,000.  A  beautiful  little  iron  screw-steamer,  rigged  as  a  three threemasted  masted threemasted  schooner,  and  a  very  fine  model,  is  completing  her  fittings  in  the  Birkenhead  float.  She  has  been  built  by  Mr.  Laird  for  the  Admiralty,  as  a  despatch  boat  for  the  Bermuda  station.  ACCIDENT  IN  THE  SLoYNE.--The  screw  steamer  Delta,  in  getting  under  way  yesterday  morning  'in  the  Sloyne,  g)t  athwart  the  hawse  of  the  Persia.  The  Delta  lost  her  funnel,  &amp;c.,  and  the  figurehead  of  the  Persia  was  damaged  by  the  loss  of  one  of  the  arms.  SUSPICIOUS  DEATH  OF  A  CAPTAlN.—Yesterday  morning  about  half-past  6,  Capt.  Henry  Charles  Webb,  of  the  barque  St,  Lawrence,  lying  in  the  Huskisson-dock,  was  found  dead  in  his  berth,  under  strong  suspicious  circumstances.  there  wilt  be  an  inquiry  into  the  case  this  day.  AMERICAN  MAILS.—The  new  and  splendid  royal  mail  steamer  Persia  sails  this  day  for  New  York  with  the  mails,  &amp;c.  Letters  will  be  received  at  the  General  Post-office  up  to  nine,  and  with  fees  up  to  ten  o'clock  ;  at  the  landing landingsta,cfe  sta,cfe landingsta,cfe  box  until  eleven  o'clock,  with  additional  fees.  DE;TH  OF  BISHOP  BROWN.—Yesterday  morning,  Dr.  Brown,  Roman  Catholic  bishop  of  Liverpool,  died  suddenly,  at  his  residence,  Sandfield  Park.  Ile  had  not  been  in  perfect  health  for  some  years  past.  He  will  be  succeeded  by  Dr.  Goss,  who  has  been  his  coadjutor  for  about  two  years  and  a  half.  SECOND  WRANGLER  AT  CAMBRIDGE.—A  telegraphic  message  was  received  about  eleven  o'clock  yesterday  morning,  announcing  that  the  second  place  in  the  highest  in  the  mathematical  honours  at  Cambridge  had  been  awarded  to  Mr.  Rigby,  who  was  educated  in  the  upper  school  of  the  Collegiate  Institution,  after  being  promoted  from  the  middle  school,  and  was  elected  as  Canning  scholar  to  Trinity  College,  Cambridge,  in  1852.  THE  LATE  MURDEROUS  ATTACK  - STYLE=superscript  IN  SOUTH  CASTLE CASTLESTREET.—As  STREET.—As CASTLESTREET.—As  stated  in  our  paper  of  yesterday,  the  young  man  Hughes,  who  was  so  brutally  attacked  by  the  brothers  Eyre,  is,  we  are  glad  to  say,  progressing  favourably,  and  it  is  expected  he  will  soon  be  able  to  resume  his  duties.  It  is  hoped  he  will  be  able  to  appear  at  the  police  court  on  Thursday  next,  to  which  day  the  prisoners  stand  remanded.  The  assailants  of  Mr.  Hughes  were  formerly  in  positions  of  respectability—the  eldest  having  been  engaged  at  Messrs.  Saul  and  Martindale's,  and  the  youngest  in  the  National  and  Provincial  Insurance  Company.  Our  informant  adds  that  they  are  well-educated,  and  possess  much  intelligence.  The  police  never  had  (they  say)  any  charge  against  them  before  the  present.  THE  ALLEGED  POISONING  AT  MANCHESTER  —On  Thursday  morning,  Mr.  Bradlaugh,  of  London,  who  ap appeared  peared appeared  for  the  prosecution  in  the  poisoning  case,  heard  at  the  city  police  court  on  Wednesday,  applied  at  the  , STYLE=superscript  office  of  the  city  coroner  for  a  warrant  to  have  the  body  of  the  deceased  John  Monahan—supposed  to  have  been  poisoned  by  acetate  of  lead—exhumed.  A  formal  information  hav having  ing having  been  sworn  to,  the  application  was  granted.  At  the  city  police  court,  Mr.  Fernley  appeared  to  make  an  ap application  plication application  that  James  Monahan,  suspected  to  be  implicated  in  .the  murder  of  his  father,  John  Monahan,  by  poison.  should  be  admitted  to  bail.  The  bench  retired  to  their  room  to  consult,  and  after  having  been  absent  for  a  few  minutes,  Mr.!Rickards  said  they  had  given  the  case  their  best  consideration,  and  they  had  come  to  the  unanimous  opinion  that  this  was  a  case  of  such  great  importance,  and  surrounded  with  so  much  suspicion,  that  they  could  not  admit  the  parties  to  bail.  FURIOUS  Daly's/G.—Yesterday  at  the  Police-court  several  parties,  cabmen  and  others,  were  fined  by  Mr.  Mansfield  in  penalties  from  ss.  to  20s.  for  furious  driving  in  the  streets.  Almost  every  member  of  the  community  can  speak,  from  his  own  experience  of  hair-breadth  'scapes  from  being  driven  over,  of  the  height  which  this  nuisance  has  attained  in  Liverpool  ;  but  it  will  not  be  suppressed  until  some  of  the  gentlemen  drivers,  mho  are  fond  of  shewing  the  pace  of  their  nags,  are  also  summoned  before  magistrate  and  severely  fined.  It  was  only  yesterday  morning  that  a  gentleman  crossing  Lord-street  from  South  John  -street  had  the  narrowest  escape  of  being  impaled  on  the  shafts  of  a  gig,  or  driven  over.  He  only  tdi  ace  erinv  ati  driving  gr  ewj  jumped  t  l  i  ee  the  pony  thescirdi  side.  p  .e  o  u  n  Tt  y  hh  ,  ae  a  t  and  such  te  ;  ee  saved  himself  by  p  l  ac  i  ng  his  hands  against  the  chest  of  g  a  h  w STYLE=superscript  u  cwsohbet  wasshter  u  p STYLE=superscript  c  o  ig STYLE=superscript  bu  n  t  w STYLE=superscript  its  was  scarcely  re-seated  when  off  he  started  at  the  same  furious  speed  to  the  imminent  danger  of  a  number  of  persons  who  were  at  the  moment  crossing  at  Whitechapel.  NEW  RAILWAY  OFFICES  AT  BIRKENHEAD.  --The  Birken Birkenhead,  head, Birkenhead,  Lancashire,  and  Cheshire  Junction  Railway  Com Company  pany Company  are  erecting  a  magnificent  pile  of  new  offices  on  the  mar  g  in  of  the  Birkenhead  fl  o  at,  n  ear  the  Emigrants'  -home.  The  buildings  are  of  bright  red  brick,  faced  with  white  and  red  free-stone,  something  in  the  style  of  Walmer  and  Aspley-buildings,  in  this  town,  :;but  with  more  architec architectu*al  tu*al architectu*al  ornamentation  about  them.  Attached  to  the  offices  is  a  spacious  new  goods  station,  fitted  with  all  the  modern  mechanical  appliances  for  lifting  heavy  weights.  Under  this  shed  a  small  dock  has  been  constructed,  which  will  communicate  with  the  Great-float  ;  and  thus  vessels  can  discharge  in  all  weathers,  without  risk  of  damaging  the  finest  goods.  The  buildings  altogether  will  cover  about  three  or  four  acres  of  ground,  and  this  additional  accom accommodation  modation accommodation  has  been  provided  by  the  railway  company,  in  anticipation  of  a  great  increase  of  business,  consequent  upon  the  purchase  of  the  Birkenhead  docks  by  the  Liver Liverpool  pool Liverpool  corporation.  The  goods  station  is  already  covered  in,  the  offices:have  reached  the  second  story,  and  the  whole  range  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  about  two  months.

During  the  course  of  the  evening  addresses  on  interesting  chemical  subjects,  and  some  of  the  more  striking  features  of  the  vegetable  kingdom  were  delivered  by  Dr.  Edwards  and  Mr.  T.  C.  Archer,  illustrated  with  specimens  and  experiments.  Mr.  Edwin  Smith  presided  at  the  pianoforte,  and  his  efforts,  combined  with  those  of  Mr.  Haswell,  vocalist,  gave  great  satisfaction.  Mr.  John  Herd,  one  of  the  com committee,  mittee, committee,  also  played  some  pieces  in  excellent  style.  The  Younger  portion  of  the  assembly  were  much  disappointed  that  the  evening  was  not  wound  up  with  a  dance  (as  had  b STYLE=superscript  ren  expected),  the  permission  of  the  reverend  chairman  having  been  obtained,  but  owing  to  the  strong  objectionentertainedained  by  the  Rev.

Eaton,  in  his  circular  issued  to-day,  makes  the  following  remarks  on  the  Tallow  Trade  :--  The  improvement  noted  at  the  close  of  the  London  market  last  Thursday  has  not  continued,  a  gradual  decline  taking  place  on  the  two  succeeding  days,  and  as  low  as  57s  per  cwt  was  accepted  for  March  delivery  on  Saturday  ;  on  Monday  a  good  demand  caused  a  strong  reaction  from  59s  to  60s  per  cwt  for  spring  delivery,  but  the  market  closed  yesterday  at  rather  lower  rates,  the  quoted  prices  being  58s  3d  to  64  for  January  to  March,  58s  64  March,  and  58s  6d  to  59s  per  cwt  on  the  spot,  with  but  little  tallow  offering.  The  present  stock  is  21,973  casks,  against  34,806  casks  last  year,  and  prices  are  is  6d  per  cwt  higher.
