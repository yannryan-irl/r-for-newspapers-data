It  Is  to  be  regretteil  that  we  have  among  the  Employers  of  Liver.

As  we  judge  of  nen  by  their  actions,  and  not  by  the  utterance  thee  may  give  to  cer cer-'n-senttrnents,  -'n-senttrnents, cer-'n-senttrnents, STYLE=superscript  we  respectfully  make  this  appeal  to  •our  fellow.  workmen,  and  call  upon  them  to  chew  their  Utter  contempt  of  such  hypocritical  cant,  by  ceasing  to  purchase  newspapers  not  'found  In  the  subjoined  list.  •  We  feel  confident  that  by  adontlng  the  course  we  recommend,  you  can  afford  us  Invaliable  aid,  In  our  endeavours  to  overthrow  that  power  which  seeks  to  reduce  the  inenshers  Of  our  profession  to  the  condition  of  serfs.  riaarnitch  as  we  do  not  cull  upon  you  to  make  any  yacrihce,  neither  debar  you  frirn  purchasing,  at  a  cheap  rate,  the  -  14 STYLE=superscript  51111  of  the  daY.:2-for  J.01%8144  appends4-bereto  emptu  room  its  ''en  for  selection.  the  proprietors  of  which,  we  have  pleasure  in  stating,  act  up  to  the  Rules  that  we  have  , STYLE=superscript  adopted  for  our  guidance,  lied  are  therefore  worthy  of  your  warmest  support,  which  we  trust  You  will  willingly  give.

We  are  not  ignorant  of  the  favourite  s STYLE=superscript  tatement  used  by  many  of  the'working  classes  with  regard  to  this  Stetter,  that  the  work  so  done  Is  at  a  cheap  rate.  This  we  consider  a  fallacy,  inasmuch  as'  inferiority  of  workmanship  is  no  proof  of  .hcapness.  But  supposing  suelt.to  be  the.case,  we  ask  you  to  con consider  sider consider  how  many  of  your  fellow-workmen  you  are  causing  to  suffer  by  an  endeavour  to  save  a  trifling  sum;  and  further,  the  amount  of  support  you  give  to  those  employers  who  are  antagonistic  to  our  advancement.  ilespectinliy  calling  your  careful  attention  to  the  foregoing,  WO  itinals  on  behalf  of  the  Tracic•,  Josirn  ASHTON.

The  above  speaks  for  itself.  The  only  reply  wo  need  make  is  that  we  choose  to  conduct  our  own  business.in  our  own  way  as  we  have  done  from  the  commencement;  that  we  pay  higher  wages  than  any  other,  newspaper  in  Liverpool,  and  that  we  know  of  no  reason  why  we  should  slut,  the  whims  and  fancies  of  the  Liverpool  Typo Typographical  graphical Typographical  We  would  remind  the  authors  of  the  document,  however,  that  they  have  rendered  themselves  amenable  to  the  law,  if  we  chose  to  act  its  vindictively  as  they  themselves  act.  We  can,  however,  afford  to  pity  and  forgive  their  malevolenre,  notwithstanding,  after  three  months  hard  labour,  finding  their  circular  has  not  had  the  effect  desired,  the  authors  have,  we  have  been  given  to  understand,  Towle  an  appeal,  and  paid  bribes  to  certain  news  agents  not  to  exhibit  the  daily  contents  placard,  or  even  to  sell  the  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES.  We  could  'scarcely  believe  the  truth  of  this,  but  we  have  cvntly  received  so  many  evidences  of  the  faot,  that  WE  are  telt  without  any  room  to  doubt  it  and  which  wi  lt  account  for  the  complaints  we  have  had  from  many  respectable  parties  who  have  represented  to  us,  that  w  hen  aI)  porebase  or  subscribe  for  the  Not(  rialto,  DAIL  lc  Tia  Ls.  ti  n  y  have  been  strongly  pressed  to  take  some  other  japer  behead.
