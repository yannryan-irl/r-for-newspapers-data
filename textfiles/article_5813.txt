"JAMAICA.  We  have  received  a  file  of  the  Kingston  Morning  Journal,  from  the  31st  of  October  to  thq  12th  of  November,  inclu inclusive,  sive, inclusive,  but  find  no  news  of  much  importance.  The  question  of  import  duties  remained  unsettled.  The  House  of  As  embly  had  deferred  the  passing  of  the  bill  until  the  committee  appointed  to  consider  the  propositions  of  the  colonial  secretary  with  regard  to  a  responsible  government  make  their  report;  but  in  the  meantime  and  in  order  to  prevent  the  further  loss  of  revenue,  the  boa.o  adopted  a  reso resolatioa  latioa resolatioa  ;similar  to  one  acted  upon  in  1849,  declaring  that  the  duties  to  be  levied  under  the  import  bill,  when  passed,  shall  take  effect  from  the  3rd  November  inst.,  in  accordance  with  the  last  existing  tariff.  Business  matters  have  not  improved  under  these  circumstances.  Indeed  so  little  confidence  is  placed  in  the  permanency  of  fiscal  legislation  in  the  colony,  and  especially  at  this  juncture,  that  nu  purchasers  on  specu speculation  lation speculation  or  to  any  extent  can  be  effected.  .  .  The  matter  of  the  contemplated  excise  on  spirits  is  considered  impracticable,  and  will  probably  be  aban abandoned.  doned. abandoned.  Supplies  of  imported  goods  are  generally  ample.  The  articles  most  in  demand,  and  the  stocks  of  which  might  be  increased  without  largely  affecting  the  present  value,  are  pickled  fish,  codfish  in  boxes,  butter,  lard,  rice,  corn  and  candles.  Produce  is  quiet."
