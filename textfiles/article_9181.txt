LIVERPOOL,  SATURDAY  EVENING  There  has  been  less  excitement  in  the  Liverpool  Cotton  market  to-day,  but  prices  have  been  steady,  and  a  large  business  has  been  done,  the  sales  amounting  to  10,000  bales,  inclusive  of  3,000  taken  for  speculation  and  export.

The  result  is  thus  recorded  in  the  circular  of  Messrs.  A.  Gartside  and  Co.,  issued  this  evenim  Home  and  foreign  buyers  attended  numerously,  probably  with  the  hope  of  obtaining  a  concession  in  price,  in  consequence  of  the  large  quantity  offered,  particularly  in  the  case  of  East  India,  of  which  there  have  been  9,695  bales.

The  quantities  offered  and  prices  realised  are  detailed  below,  viz.:  -9,695  bales  East  India:  Part  of  these  eonsisted  of  clean  and  well  selected  parcels,  but  there  was  a  greater  proportion  than  usual  of  half-washed  and  inferior  lots.

The  circular  of  Mr.  William  Avens,  of  London,  gives  the  following  review  of  the  London  Stock.  and  Share  Market  for  the  past  week  :  A  great  change  has  come  over  the  market  since  my  last.  When  I  had  last  the  pleasure  of  addressing  my  friends  and  clients,  business  was  certainly  improving,  but  rations  were  restricted  by  the  state  of  political  uncer uncer  - uncer  as  to  the  prospects  of  peace,  and  the  unsatisfactory  of  the  money  market.  Now,  however,  there  are  'ations  of  peace,  or  at  least  of  the  opening  of  peace,  while  the  money  market,  though  is  decidedly  easier.  These  influences  have  produced  a  beneLial  effect,  for  business  has  revived,  and  the  prices  of  all  descriptions  of  public  securities  have  considerably  advanced.

On  Monday  and  Tuesday  the  substance  of  the  Russian  counter-propositions  - STYLE=superscript  became  known,  and  being  thought  to  be  such  as  would  satisfy  the  interests  of  Great  Britain  in  undertaking  the  war,  a  decided  advance  :  set  in  ;  consols  which  closed  on  Saturday  at  851  to  861,  having  improved  on  Tuesday  to  86  ;  7-;  to  87.  This  was  merely  upon  the  strength  of  the  impression  that  if  Russia  did  not  concede  all  the  conditions  demanded  by  the  Allies,  she  was  at  least  disposed  to  offer  some  terms  which  could  not  be  regarded  as  unacceptable.  On  Wednes-  day,  however,  the  foreign  journals  reported  that  she  had  proposed  to  go  further—that  is  to  accept  the  conditions  •  icd  to  restrict  her  influence  and  power  in  the  Bal  .  .  .  open(  YL4aI•C  4.0.0  n  Toyed  until  ,t  861  to  86  rapidly  buyers  at  87  'ever,  took  9  before  - STYLE=superscript  the  close  hut  after  hours  they  recovered,  3St  after  t  froni  Vienna  t"
