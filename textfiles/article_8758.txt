"MFXICO.  NICAILAGIJA  In  regard  to  the  American  republics,  which,  from  their  proximity  and  other  considerations,  have  peculiar  relations  to  this  government,  while  it  has  been  my  constant  aim  strictly  to  observe  all  the  obligations  of  political  friendship  and  of  good  neighbourhood,  obstacles  to  this  have  arisen  in  some  of  them,  from  their  own  insufficient  power  to  check  lawless  irruptions,  which  in  effect  throws  most  of  the  task  on  the  United  States.  Thus  it  is  that  the  distracted  international  condition  of  the  State  of  Nicaragua  has  made  it  incumbent  on  me  to  appeal  to  the  good  faith  of  our  citizens  to  abstain  from  unlawful  inter intervention  vention intervention  in  its  affairs,  and  to  adopt  preventive  measures  to  the  same  end,  which,  on  a  similar  occa.4on,  had  the  best  results  in  reassuring  the  peace  of  the  Mexican  States  of  Sonora  and  Lower  California."
