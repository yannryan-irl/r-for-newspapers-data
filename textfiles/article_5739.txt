"REVIEW  OF  THE  WEEK.  TEA.—The  market  has  been  inactive  throughout  the  week;  some  small  parcels  of  common  congou  with  short  prompts  have  changed  hands  at  easier  rates  ;  in  all  other  descriptions  sales  are  limited,  but  no  alteration  can  be  quoted.

BRIMSTONE  has  been.neglected  this  week,  the  sales  being  barely  100  tons,  and•  prices  a  little  easier.  '  Small  sales  of  Oporto  ARGOLS  have  taken  place  at  50s  to  52s  6d  per  cwt.,  but  TARTARS  have  been  little  inquired  for.

The  American  advices  concerning  the  crop  present  no  new  feature,  beyond  the  continued  falling  off  in  the  receipts  at  the  ports,  which  are  now  285,000  bales  less  than  at  same  period  last  year;  prices,  for  some  cause  not  explained,  had  advanced  considerably  at  New  Orleans.  The  home  con consumption  sumption consumption  is  still  curtailed  to  the  full  extent,  noticed  in  our  last  circular,  so  that  spinners  do  not  require  a  large  supply,  and  they  still  confine  their  purchases  to  the  supplying  of  their  immediate  wants.  Under  these  circumstances,  Ame American  rican American  descriptions  have  not  met  a  ready  sale,  nor  do  we  con consider  sider consider  the  market  firm,  except  for  such  qualities  as  are  Cdthparatively  scarce,  say  at  the  range  of  51d.  to  6td.  per  lb.
