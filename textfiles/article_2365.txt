"THE  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES.  FROM  OUR  LONDON  CORRESPONDENT.  1  Although  there  are  further  despatches  from  Con Constantinople  stantinople Constantinople  to-day,  they  do  not  contain  any  further  news  than  that  already  known.  They  are,  however,  somewhat  more  definite,  for  it  appears  that  the  reply  of  Count  Gortschakoff  to  Omar  Pacha  was  known  to  the  Porte,  namely,  that  he  was  neither  authorised  to  make  war,  nor  to  conclude  peace,  nor  to  evacuate  the  Principalities.  The  allied  fleets  it  appears  are  to  be  stationed  at  Gallipoli,  which  is  some  distance  from  Constantinople.  There  is  great  difficulty  in  unravelling  the  mean meaning  ing meaning  of  those  movements  ;  but  I  apprehend  they  amount  just  to  this,  that  the.  Western  powers  will  only  interfere  in  the  event  of  Turkey  not  being  able  herself  to  prevent  the  advance  of  the  aggressor.  This  construction  indeed  is  the  only  one  which  harmonizes  the  perplexing  accounts  which  reach  us  every  day.  The  war  feeling,  or  rather  the  hope  of  maintain maintaining  ing maintaining  peace,  in  Paris  has  again  become  nil."
