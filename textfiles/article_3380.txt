This,  added  to  the  receipts  per  Humboldt  and  Canada,  makes  £132,500  of  specie  received  since  Saturday.  Large  arrivals  of  the  precious  metal  are  expected  from  Australia  before  the  close  of  the  week.  The  advices  last  received  from  all  the  sugar,  coffee,  and  cotton-producingicountries,  are  highly  ,  satisfac satisfactory,  tory, satisfactory,  and  must  eventually  produce  easy  markets  for  such  produce  in  this  country.  The  demand  for  ship shipping  ping shipping  for  the  gold  regions  has  touched  its  highest  points  which  will  make  freights  easier  and  on  the  whole  we  are  led  to  anticipate  a  healthy  state  of  things  in  the  home  market.  The  failure  in  the  fruit  crops,  which  we  have  from  time  to  time  noticed,  will  now  show  itself  in  a  scarcity  of  supply  and  ad advanced  vanced advanced  rates,  the  season  for  the  largest  consump consumption  tion consumption  being  close  at  hand.  In  Teas  also,  we  appre apprehend  hend apprehend  short  deliveries  for  some  time  to  come,  owing  to  the  disturbed  state  of  the  Chinese  domin dominions.  ions. dominions.

From  these  two  quarters  only,  do  we  see  the  possibility  of  any  change  in  the  produce  business  of  Europe.  Since  the  22nd  ult.,  three  cargoes  of  New  Valentias  have  arrived,  making  the  total  importation  to  this  date  and  to  the  same  date  of  the  two  previous  years—  Boxes.

The  stock  of  new  Valentias  in  the  warehouses  on  the  Ist  inst.  was  1600  tons,  against  2000  tons  on  the  Ist  November,  1852.  We  were  then  re receiving  ceiving receiving  large  supplies  of  new  Turkey  fruit  in  boxes,  which  were  going  freely  into  consumption  at  475.  to  51s.  As  the  London  clearance  of  raisins  in  November  and  December  in invariably  variably invariably  reach  from  2800  to  3000  tons,  it  would  seem  that  if  the  consumption  do  not  turn  upon  old  Chesmes,  which  is  not  likely  before  Christmas,  the  present  supply  of  other  sorts,  with  what  is  afloat:from  Denis,  will  not  be  too  much  for  our  usual  consumption.  The  importers  in  Liverpool  have  maintained  their  price  at  50s.  to  535.,  whilst  at  the  London  market  475.  to  495.,  which  barely  covers  cost,  has  been  readily  accepted  by  most  of  the  importers  for  middling  quality,  without  leading  to  an  increase  in  the  actual  deliveries,  a  sure  criterion,  as  with  currants,  of  the  great  consuming  season  not  having  yet  commenced.  Old  Chesme  barrels  of  fine  quality  have  been  bought  at  445.,  and  no  more  to  be  had  thereat  ;  in  other  descriptions  scarcely  any  business  has  been  done.  A  good  supply  of  black  Smyrna  will  arrive  before  Christmas,  and  when  the  season  really  begins,  there  is  no  doubt  of  their  being  extensively  taken  ;  a  demand  for  them  has  already  commenced  in  Liverpool.  nos.—The  arrivals  having  been  light,  and  still  higher  prices  being  de demanded,  manded, demanded,  sales  have  been  difficult.  The  total  supply  this  year  will  be  unusually  small.  PRIINES.-A  Treasury  order  has  been  issued,  dated  28th  October,  permitting  the  admission  of  German  plums  into  this  country  until  Ist  August  next  at  the  duty  of  7s.  per  cwt.  ;  we  may  consequently  look  for  large  supplies,  the  crop  having  been  most  abundant.  Messrs.  TVhitherby  and  Hansom,  fruit  and  colonial  brokers,  give  the  following  statement  of  their  market  :  CURRANTS.  —The  arrivals  since  our  report  of  22d  ult.  have  been  one  cargo  of  old  and  two  cargoes  of  this  year's  fruit,  one  from  Patras  and  ono  from  Cephalonia.  To  this  date  of  1852  eight  cargoes  with  950  tons  of  new  f  r  uit,  h  a  d  arrived,  and  to  7th  November  1851,  52  cargoes,  with  7450  tons.  The  clearances  for  consumption  in  October  were  only  180  tons,  or  6  tons  per  diem,  against  1570  tons  in  October,  1852,  and  against  1300  tons  in  October,  1851.  The  deli deliveries  veries deliveries  in  bond  were  205  tons,  of  which  85  tons  to  the  colonies,  85  tons  to  the  Continent,  and  35  tons  coastwise.  The  Liverpool  clearances  lu  October  were  4o  tons,  against  200  tons  in  October,  1852.  The  English  Funds  have  been  less  buoyant  to today.  day. today.  Consols  opened  at  95  to  I,  and  about  12  o'clock  reached  95f  to  .4,  since  then  there  has  been  a  retrogression  in  prices,  and  a  great  deficiency  of  Money  Stock  offering,  so  that  prices  last  quoted  at  944  to  254  for  the  Dec.

The  result  of  the  discussions  of  the  Cabinet  Council  held  to  day,  and  which  have  not  yet  reached  the  City,  are  anxiously  looked  for.

The  sales  amounted  to  5,000  bales  only,  of  which  1,000  were  taken  on  speculation  and  for  export.
