Last  evening  the  above  society  held  their  usual  periodical  meeting,  at  the  Royal  Institution,  Colquitt-street,  The  presi president,  dent, president,  Mr.  J.  Hay,  occupied  the  chair.  _  .  .  .  The  secretary  announced  that  the  society  had  been  presented  with  two  tinted  bird's-eye  views  of  Liverpool  in  1655  and  in  1855.  The  Chairman  then  directed  attention  to  the  following  resolution,  which  had  been  passed  in  December  last  :  That  though  this  society  has  the  power  of  enforcing  payment  of  the  subscriptions  in  arrear,  by  the  Literary  Institution  Act,  yet,  in  , STYLE=superscript  lieu  of  taking  legal  proceedings  against  those  members  more  than  twelve  months  in  arrear,  who  have  neither  acknowledged  the  letters  of  the  secretary,  nor  promised  their  subscriptions,  it  is  decided  that  they  shall  be  read  out  on  the  first  public  meet meeting  ing meeting  in  January,  He  added,  that  upon  consideration  of  the  matter  the  council  had  found,  that  out  of  150  members,  there  were  only  eleven  in  arrears:—  five  of  that  number  had  come  forward  and  paid  up  their  subscriptions,  three  were  in  bad  health,  one  had  sent  an  insolent  reply,  :two  had  sent  no  reply  at  all.  Mr.  William  Stubbs  was  elected  an  associate  member.  The  Secretary  read  a  letter  from  Mr.  T.  W.  Jones,  point.  ing  out  tho  inaocuraciee  mocto  in  a  roport  of  the  ooeioty's  lair  annual  excursion  relative  to  Crewe  Castle,  and  said  he  would  comparo  it  with  the  official  reports.  The  Chairman  then,  in  a  very  lengthy  paper,  introduced  the  business  of  the  evening  :  Whether  it  was  desirable  or  not  for  this  society  to  co-operate  with  the  London  Architectural  Association  in  endeavouring  to  obtain  the  issue  of  a  Mr.  Boult  on  giving  his  views  on  the  subject,  expressed  himself  in  favour  of  the  profession  obtaining  a  certificate,  but  that  architecture  and  engineering  should  be  combined.  He  denied  that  such  a  system  was  alien  to  the  spirit  of  the  age.  He  concluded  by  proposing  a  resolution  to  the  effect  that  the  meeting  was  favourable  to  a  systematic  course  of  education,  and  that  the  society  was  willing  to  co-operate  with  the  Society  of  British  Artists  to  obtain  a  certificate.  Mr.  Thomas  M,  Rickman  offered  a  few  observations  in  favour  of  the  views  enunciated  in  the  resolution.  Mr.  Rimmer  did  not  agree  with  the  former  speaker,  and  he  thought  there  were  several  almost  insupportable  objections  to  the  allowing  of  a  certificate,  or  a  diploma.  Mr.  Hay  agreed  with  the  views  expressed  by  Mr.  Boult,  the  mover  of  the  resolution.  The  Secretary  concurred  in  the  general  observations  of  the  gentlemen  who  had  spoken  in  favour  of  the  architect  having  a  regular  education,  and  in  favour  of  their  having  a  certificate.  The  Mover  of  the  resolution  was  hero  informed  that  his  motion  had  not  been  seconded.  Mr.  James  Hay  then  seconded  the  resolution.  Mr.  Verelst  next  addressed  the  meeting.  He  conceived  that  the  students  should  exert  more  energy  than  they  did,  and  then  neither  diploma  or  certificate  would  be  required.  He  replied  to  some  of  the  arguments  adduced  by  the  mover  of  the  resolution.  He  concluded  by  observing  that  he  bad  not  been  able  to  form  a  decided  opinion,  but  he  thought  he  was  rather  more  opposed  to  the  resolution  than  otherwise.  Mr.  Davis  suggested,  as  the  meeting  was  so  very  small  that  the  resolution  should  not  be  decided  upon  on  that  occasion.  The  Chairman  concurred  in  the  suggestion.  Mr.  Boult  replied  to  some  of  the  spakers  observations.  After  which  the  resolution  was  carried  by  a  majority  of  five  to  three.
