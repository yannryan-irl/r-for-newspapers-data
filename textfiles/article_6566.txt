The  steamer  of  today  carries  about  one  million  dollars.  In  breadstuffs  since  last  advices  we  have  had.  a  . STYLE=superscript  somewhat  steady  demand,  without  much  change  in  prices.  On  - STYLE=superscript  Wednesday  the  market  opened  dull,  and  sales  were  mostly  for  home  consumption.  Canadian  was  moderate,  at  $7  per  barrel.  Southern  •  Unchanged  in  price,  and  in  demand  moderate.  On  Thursday,  common  brands  to  a  fair-extent  were  selling,  but  holders  were  compelled  to  slacken  prices  in  order  to  •realise.  Southern  was  without  change,  and  little  offering.  Wheat  little  doing;  price  rather  in  - STYLE=superscript  favour  of  the  buyer.  On  Friday  the  market  for  wheat  and  flour  ex exhibited_  hibited_ exhibited_  some  change  unde  r  th  e  Ni  agara  '  s  news  received  via  Halifax  by  telegraph.  Flour  became  dull  ;  and  to  effect  sales,  a  decline  of  61  cents  was  submitted:  to.  Wheat  was  held  firmer,  at  slightly  improved  prices.  The  cotton  market  has  been  heavy  during  the  past  week,  but  without  material  change  in  price  since  Monday  last.  The  sales  the  past  three  days.  have  been  small;  but  no  quotable  reduction  in  rates  '  is  visible.  Sales  yesterday  were  made  of  2,816  bales.  Fair  Mobile  and  New  Orleans,  at  114  for  the  former,  and  114  to  12-1  for  the  latter.  The  firm  of  N.  Cunningham  &amp;  Co.,  Boston,  mer  -  chants,  failed.  yesterday.  Liabilities  reported  at  150,000  dols.  They  were  extensively  engaged  in  the  California  and  Australian  trade.  In  reference  to  •  the  steamer  Humboldt,  New  York  Tribune  of  the  9th  instant  says  iB'full  of  water,  and  there  is  no  prospect  of  gett,  her  off.  The  steamship  Marion,  of  the  Chariest°,  line,  has  been  chartered  by  the  underwriters  to  proceed  to  Halifax  and  receive  on  board  whatever  cargo  may  be  saved  from  the  steamship  Humboldt,  and  bring-it  to  this  port.  She  is  to  leave  at  nine  o'clock  this  morning,  and  will  take  round  with.  her  three  steam  pumps,  and  all  necessary  wreck wrecking  ing wrecking  apparatus  .  used  in  getting  vessels  afloat,  as  well  as  several  men  versed  in  the  wrecking  buSiness,  to  give  ne  cessary  instructions,  and  aid,  if  possible,  in  floating  the  Humboldt.  The  latest  dispatches  frOm  the  vessel  state  that  120  cases  of  gOods  had  been  landed,  also  the  cabin  furniture.  The  flowing  in  and  out  of  water  continued.  If  the  weather  proved  tine,  as  it  then  was,  most  of  the  cargo  Would  be  saved—damaged  ;  but  there  was  little  hope  of  saving  the  ship;  pumps  would  be  o  f  service,  but  none  there  were  there.  It  is  supposed  that  should  the  wind  continue  to  blow  from  the  south  until  the  arrival  of  the  pumps,  she  would  be  freed  from  water,  and  taken  up'tb  HaPfax  ;  but  should  it  change  to  the  eastward,  nothing  can  save  her.  Her  cargo  is  estimated  at  $lOO,OOO,  which  is  heavily  covered,  both  in  Wall  street  and  in  France:  We  learn  of  an  insurance  on  the  vessel  to-the  extent  of  $70,000,  $40,000  of  which  falls  to  Boston  companies.  —she  NEW  YORK  MARKETS.—SEPT.  10.  MONEY  AND  STOCKS.—Money  was  rather  more  easy,  at  previous  rates,  and  there  ha  s  b  een  more  di  spos  i  t  i  on  to  take  good  paper  at  the  legal  rates,  while  the  range  is  9  to  10  for  choice  signatures  ,  in  the  stre  e  t,  an  d  12  to  15  for  unknown.  The  money  offering  at  call  is  greater,  and  many  of  the  stock  houses  decline  it  over  5  per  cent.  The  Exchange  market  has  been  dull  this  week,  and  the  rates  for  the  packet  closed  dull  at  91  to  91;  francs,  5.15  to  5.122  ;  good  bills  are  held  at  less  rates,  however.  The  Stock  Market  has  been  very  flat  during  the  week.  There  seems  to  be  . STYLE=superscript  next  to  no  demand  for  stocks,  and  little  disposition  to  sell—a  state  of  affairs  not  inconsistent  with  abundance  of  money,  and  the  approach  of  the  holidays.  It  is  undoubtedly  the  case,  that  the  market  is  oppressed  with  the  considerable  quantities  of  railroad  bonds  and  mining  stocks,  that  have  been  put  upon  the  market  during  the  past  year.  Of  the  former,  considerable  stocks  remain  pledged  for  loans,  which  cannot  be  got  in  until  the  market  becomes  again  active  ;  and  mining  stocks,  of  no  value  whatever,  have  been  thrust  upon  the  market  remaining  dull,  and  every  day  losing  their  vitality,  for  want  of  any  intrinsic  value.  The  Daniel  Webster,  at  New  Orleans,  from  San  Juan,  brings  $400,000,  and  reports  the  departure  of  the  Star  of  the  West  for  New  York,  Dec.  1,  with  $1,465,000;  and  the  Oefrom  were,  eh  r  o  e  e  rge  ,exinp  L  oAr  aiv  roican  speciegAo  ls  gold  fromi  e  n  o  w  in  a  ,  ll  t;h:s4  same7,pso  port  o  d  t  a;  Nov.tei  n  ,  g  w  o  i  t  t  sl  h  ,2i  ,  1  $  1t:3  ,  5  5  9  0  D7  0  ,e  ,  8  0  c7.  0  9  0  3;  .  ,  in  silver,  $47,000  ;  foreign  coins,  $505,878.
