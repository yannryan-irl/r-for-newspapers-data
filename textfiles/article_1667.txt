It  nppeffrs  - STYLE=superscript  however,  - STYLE=superscript  thut  the  foregoing  was  not  the  com commencement  mencement commencement  of  the  misunderstanding.  We  find  that  pre previously  viously previously  there  had  been  a  misunderstanding  between  alargenum alargenumber  ber alargenumber  of  the  masters  of  American  vessels  and  the  commandante  of  the  island.  It  appears  that  two  seamen,  belonging  to  the  American  ship  Defiance,  were  arrested  by  the  police  and  con confined  fined confined  on  board  the  guard  ship  for  shootmg  a  pelican.  The  Captain  of  the  Defiance,  upon  learning  the  fact,  repaired  to  the  guard-ship  and  asked  the  lieutenant  in  command,  what  was  the  fine  imposed,  and  was  informed  it  was  a  .  dolor.  This  amount  he  tendered,  and  reqnested  the  release  of  the  men.  The  commandante  refused  to  release  them.  The  American  captains  then  held  a  public  meeting,  remon remonstrating  strating remonstrating  against  such  arbitrary  proceedings,  and  appointed  a  deputation  of  twenty-five  of  their  number  to  wait  upon  the  commandante  and  acquaint  them  of  their  proceedings.  Upon  their  arrival  on  board  the  guard-ship  the  commandate  treated  them  with  the  greatest  rudeness,  and  ordered  the  troops  on  deck  with  loaded  muskets  and  fixed  bayonets,  and  then  pre presumptuously  sumptuously presumptuously  ordered  the  captains  comprising  the  deputation  into  their  own  boats.  This  order  they  proceeded  to  obey,  but,  whilst  in  the  act  of  getting  into  their  boats,  the  guards  rushed  upon  them  with  their  bayonets,  and  several  of  them  were  seriously  injured.  The  captain  of  the  Defiance  was  supposed  to  be  mortally  wounded.  The  outrage  has  been  represented  to  the  United  States  government  at  Washington  by  the  Minister  residing  at  Lima.  Mr.  Quimbey,  (Adams  &amp;  Co's  messenger  from  Australia,)  is  the  bearer  of  the  Minister's  despatch.  The  dates  from  Caracas,  Venezula,  received  by  the  way  of  Havanah,  are  up  to  the  3rd.  of  September.  The  Diaro  de  la  Marina,  quoting  from  the  Caracas  journals,  says  that  with  the  exception  of  two  small  parties  of  revolutionists  having  been  routed  and  dispersed  into  the  province  of  Barcelona,  there  is  nothing  to  confirm  the  rumour  of  the  political  dis disturbance  turbance disturbance  being  renewed.  From  Bolivia  we  hear  of  continued  outbreaks  against  the  Government  of  President  Bebyn,  who  was  obliged  to  keep  on  the  march  a  large  body  of  troops  to  quell  the  revolution revolutionary  ary revolutionary  spirit  clesplayed  in  various  districts  of  the  country.  The  want  of  unanimity  among  the  people,  prevented  Bebyn  from  commencing  any  decided  attack  against  Peru,  and  entirely  paralyzed  everything  in  the  shape  of  business  throughout  the  republic.  The  Pan'anteno  states  that  the  British  and  French  Minis Ministers  ters Ministers  in  Peru  made  application  to  the  Government  for  per permission  mission permission  to  send  each  a  duly  qualified  Commissioner  to  the  Chincha  Islands,  for  the  purpose  of  reporting  upon  the  state  of  thc  Islands  and  the  quantity  of  Guano,  but  that  the  request  was  refused.  We  think  this  statement,  if  correct,  a  very  suspicious  one,  and  tends  to  confirm  the  statement  published  by  Elias,  of  the  rapidly  decreasing  stock  of  that  article,  which,  according  to  his  statement,  cannot  last  much  more  than  eight  years  longer.  A  Commission  from  the  Peruvian  Government  is  at  present  investigating  the  subject.  The  Ecuadorian  journals  confirm  the  rumour  that  Flores  meditates  another  expedition  against  that  country,  with  forces  raised  in  Chili  and  California.  In  Para,  Brazil,  there  were  fears  entertained  of  the  scarcity  of  corn,  and  the  municipality  had  issued  an  order  creating  a  public  depot  in  the  city.  -  There  was  a  project  about  being  realized  for  building  a  railroad  and  electric  telegraph  between  Bahia  Joazeiro.  The  Brazilian  Minister  at  London  had  nearly  concluded  ne negotiations  gotiations negotiations  for  - STYLE=superscript  the  purpose,  with  an  English  company;consist company;consisting  ing company;consisting  of  Baron  Goldsmith,  Alderman  Thompson,  M.P.  and  Messrs.  King,  Hope,  Carter,  and  Kennard.  The  grant  was  to  be  made  to  them  for  ninety  years,  the  railroad  then  re reverting  verting reverting  to  the.  Government,  who  are  at  liberty  to  purchase  it  at  the  end  of  thirty  years.  The  capital  of  the  company  is  to  be  realised  by  shares  of  $lOO.  It  is  expected  that  the  first  engineer—then  in  Canada—would  delay  his  departure  for  Brazil  for  two  months.
