"PUBLIC  WORKS  IN  AUSTRALIA.  A  deputation  of  gentlemen  interested  in  railway  commu communication  nication communication  between  Sydney  and  Melbourne,  waited  upon  the  Duke  of  Newcastle,  secretary  of  state  for  the  colonies,  at  his  official  residence  Downing-street,  on  Thursday.  The  deputation  consisted  of  Mr.  John  Macgregor,  M.P.,  Mr.  Pigott,  M.P.  ;  Mr.  P.  Grant,  member  of  the  legislative  council  of  New  South  Wales  ;  George  F.  Young,  &amp;c.,  &amp;c.  The  deputation  having  been  indroduced  to  the  noble  duke,  _  _  Mr.  Macgregor  said  that  the  deputation  had  waited  upon  him  as  chief  secretary  for  the  colonies  to  submit  for  the  con consideration  sideration consideration  of  her  majesty's  government  the  outline  of  a  pro project  ject project  for  constructing  a  great  trunk  line  of  railway  from  Syd Sydney  ney Sydney  to  Melbourne.  The  deputation  thought  it  advisable  that  the  colonial  department  of  the  government  should  be  put  in  possession  of  the  general:outlines  of  the  undertaking  before  it  had  been  introduced  to  the  colony  ;  but  they  had  every  reason  to  believe  that  it  would  be  favourably  received  by  the  inhabitants  of  Australia  and  the  colonial  legislature.  The  towns  of  Sydney  and  Melbourne  might  be  regarded  as  the  London  and  Liverpool  of  Australia.  They  were  its  two  most  important  cities  and  ports,  and  the  want  of  rapid,  safe,  and  cheap  land  communication  between  them  was  se severely  verely severely  felt._  _  Mi.  Dredged  and  Mr.  Bull,  the  engineers,  explained  to  the  noble  duke  the  route  of  the  propose  railway,  which  they  stated  would  pass  through  the  great  gold  fields  of  the  south southern  ern southern  district,  and  near  to  that  of  Mount  Alexander.  It  would  also  pass  through  or  near  all  the  principal  towns  and  stations  of  importance  between  Sydney  and  Melbourne,  and  in  a  geographical  point  of  view  would  give  a  seaboard  to  the  valleys  of  the  Lachlan  Yass,  Murrumbidger,  and  Murray.  The  total  distance  would  be  500  miles,  and  of  this  about  250  miles  would  be  on  a  dead  level.  The  line  would  make  a  slight  circuit  in  order  to  accommodate  the  wants  of  a  rapidly  increasing  district  ;  but,  notwithstanding,  it  would  he  500  miles  shorter  than  the  high  road.  The  distance  between  Melbourne  and  Sydney  was  1,000  miles,  but  by  means  of  the  proposed  railway  passing  at  the  back  back  of  the  Eastern  Australian  range  it  would  be  reduced  to  500  miles.  Owing  to  the  favourable  nature  of  the  country  and  the  abundance  of  materials  at  hand,  the  line  could  be  constructed  for  £3,000  per  mile,  which  was  not  more  than  the  average  cost  of  the  railways  in  the  United  States,  on  the  principle  of  which  it  was  to  be  constructed.  The  greatest  gradient  is  42  feet  per  mile,  and  the  prevailing  gradients  are  from  15  to  20  per  mile.  The  Duke  of  Newcastle  inquired  what  was  the  estimated  expense  of  the  line  ?  The  Engineer  said  that  the  capital  proposed  to  be  raised  was  £1,000,000.  There  was  a  line  from  Sydney  to  Goulburn  in  course  of  formation,  of  which  a  few  miles  had  been  made.  The  Sydney  and  Melbourne  Company  intended  to  take  powers  to  buy  that  line  or  work  over  it,  but  their  line  would  not  oppose  it.  Mr.  Plowright  and  other  gentlemen  having  addressed  the  noble  duke,  The  Duke  of  Newcastle  said  that  he  need  not  explain  to  Mr.  Macgregor,  with  whom  he  had  had  repeated  interviews  on  colonial  subjects,  that  on  a  subject  of  this  description  the  secretary  of  state  for  the  colonies  must  really  suspend  any anything  thing anything  more  than  a  general  opinion  of  its  importance,  of  which,  however,  in  this  case,  there  seemed  to  be  no  doubt.  A  line  might  look  admirable  upon  paper,  but  he  could  not  tell  whether  there  might  not  be  others  which  might  not  be  better  for  the  colony.  On  some  occasions  it  was  also  known  that  there  were  jealousies  between  rival  towns,  and  any  overture  for  putting  them  in  direct  communication  with  each  other  might  not  be  at  first  as  much  appreciated  as  it  would  be  certain  to  be  in  the  course  of  time.  Under  these  circumstances  he  could  not  be  expected  to  express  any  official  opinion  upon  the  undertaking,  until  it  was  fairly  introduced  to  the  proper  authorities  at  Sydney  and  Mel Melbourne.  bourne. Melbourne.  Mr.  Macgregor  said  that  the  deputation  did  not  expect  the  noble  duke  to  say  more  onthe  subject  at  present;  and  in inquired  quired inquired  if  the  noble  duke  would  forward  the  plans  to  the  colonial  authorities  at  Sydney  and  Melbourne  ?  The  Duke  of  Newcastle  said  he  would  do  so  with  pleasure,  and  that  he  would  also  forward  any  statement  the  deputation  might  like  to  make  in  writing.  The  deputation  then  thanked  the  noble  duke  for  his  cour courtesy,  tesy, courtesy,  and  withdrew.—London  Paper  of  yesterday.  LIVERPOOL  MARKETS.  —YESTERDAY.
