"MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL  LIVERPOOL,  MONDAY  EVENING.  In  addiiton  to  the  large  arrivals  of  gold  •  an announced  nounced announced  in  the  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES  of  this  day,  we  have  to  report  8,000  ounces  by  the  Hope,  which  arrived  on  Saturday,  according  to  our  Lon London  don London  advices,  from  the  West  Coast  of  Africa.  The  Jane  Charlotte,  from  Adelaide,  and  the  Duke  of  Richmond,  from  Portland  Bay,  are  also  reported  to  have  a  considerable  quantity  of  specie  on  freight.  The  amount  was  not  known  when  our  despatch  left  London.  The  importations  of  gold  for  the  last  week  were  535,0001.,  which,  when  added  to  those  now  stated,  makes  the  aggregate  amount  about  660,0001.,  while  the  exports  for  .the  week  ending  Saturday,  amount  to  336,0001.  only.  The  Duke  of  Richmond  brings  1,432  bales  of  wool.  _  _  The  influx  of  gold  is  now  considerably  greater  than  the  eflux,  and  consequently  it  may  be  fairly  inferred  that  the  Bank  of  England  will  not  advance  its  rates  of  interest,  but  on  the  contrary,  will  shortly  be  disposed  to  make  some  slight  conces concession  sion concession  to  the  trading  community.  We  are  watching  closely  the  movements  of  bullion,  subsequent  to  its  arrival  in  this  country,  and  thus  far  it  does  appear  that  the  large  quantities  of  the  precious  metals  which  have  arrived  within  the  last  few  months,  have  not  found  there  way  to  the  cellars  of  the  Bank  of  Eng England.  land. England.  The  Joint  Stock  Banks  have  now  stood  the  test  of.  time,  and  their  increasing  popularity  may  in  some  measure  account  for  the  fact  we  have  alluded  to.  Recent  returns  show  that  the  deposits  in  the  Joint  Stock  Banks  of  London  alone,  amounted  to  14,000,0001,  which  is  an  increase  of  14  per  cent.  over  the  same  period  last  year.  We  have  been  favoured  with  private  advices  from  St.  Petersburg,  date  d.  the  17th  inst.,  from  which  we  make  the  following  extract  :  The  Minister  of  Finance  desired  the  attendance  of  a  deputation  of  four  English  merchants,  in  consequence  of  which  Messrs.  Gwyer,  Anderson,  Cattley,  and  Bell  waited  upon  him,  when  they  were  told,  in  the  name  of  his  Majesty  the  Emperor,  that  British  merchants  might  continue  to  transact  their  business  in  the  usual  way,  as  both  their  per persons  sons persons  and  property  should  be  respected,  whether  this  country  be  at  war  with  England  or  not.
