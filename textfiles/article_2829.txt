"LONDON  CORN  EURANGE  -YESTERDAY.  The  weather  remains  fine,  and  the  arrival  of  foreign  wheat  good.  The  attendance  at  this  morning's  market  was  small,  but  included  a  few  buyers  from  the  country,  and  in  the  business  done,  which  was  not  large,  Monday  prices  were  realised  for  both  English  and  foreign  wheat.  The  value  of  spring  corn  is  unaltered."
