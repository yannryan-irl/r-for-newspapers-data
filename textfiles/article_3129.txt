"FEARFUL  MORTALILY  ON  BOARD  EMI EMIGRANT  GRANT EMIGRANT  SHIPS  FROM  EUROPE  TO  THE  UNITED  STATES.  The  advices  by  the  Canada  give  a  fearful  account  of  the  mortality  on  board  emigrant  ships  from  Liverpool  and  other  European  ports  to  New  York.  We  give  the  particulars  as  under  from  the  New  York  Herald.  Among  the  arrivals  at  this  port  of  emigrant  ships  during  the  last  few  weeks,  a  very  large  number  of  deaths  have  been  reported.  In  one  vessel,  the  Chas.  Sprague,  the  unusually  large  number  of  forty-five  persons  died  on  the  passage  from  Bremen,  and  in  another,  the  Winchester,  from  Liverpool,  the  number  of  fatal  cases  amounted  to  no  less  than  seventy-nine.  The  following  is  the  number  of  cases  at  this  port  from  September  9th  up  to  the  present  time  :  No.  of  Pas-  Arrival.  Ships.  Where  from.  sengers.

Several,  no  doubt,  died  by  the  com common  mon common  diseases,  but  that  cholera  was  raging  on  board  many  of  the  above  named  vessels  is  beyond  all  question,  from  the  fact  that  thirty-three  persons  who  were  landed  at  Quarantine  were  suffering  from  that  epidemic.  The  sickness  on  the  Benjamin  Adams  was  decidedly  cholera  ;  and,  in  addition,  the  ship  Sagadahock,  from  Gottenburg,,which  arrived  at  Boston  yester yesterday,  day, yesterday,  reports  the  loss  of  seventy  passengers  by  the  same  disease."
