Yesterday,  the  accounts  by  the  Atlantic  being  less  favourable  than  had  been  anticipated,  the  market  lost  its  buoyancy,  closing  very  irregular,  and  some  sales  of  grades  below  middling,  it  is  understood,  were  made  at  a  slight  decline  from  the  quoted  rates.

Yesterday,  the  market  opened  slightly  easier,  owing  to  a  recurrence  of  mild  weather  here  and  at  the  west,  which  tends  greatly  to  facilitate  the  receipts,  but  towards  the  close,  with  less  offering,  there  was  .some  reaction,  and  our  revised  quotations  now  stand  about  64  cents  higher  than  on  Friday  last,  for  nearly  all  descriptions  except  State.

Yesterday  the  market  opened  easier,  but  after  the  receipt  of  the  private  letters  per  Atlantic,  there  was  a  slight  reaction,  and  more  steadiness  towards  the  cluse.
