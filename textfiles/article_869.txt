"MONETARY  ;AND  COMMERCIAL  LIVERPOOL,  WEDNESDAY  EMNING.  The  'Liverpool  Money  Market  Opened  in  ,a  state  bordering  on  collapse,  but  raiied  considerably  when  it  became  known.  thtit  the  runi.ouit  of:yes of:yesterdsT  terdsT of:yesterdsT  ti.s  to  the  position  of  ninths  in  the  East  were  not  'confirmed.  Still  the  tone  of  busineSs  bespoke  great  Micoiness.  Matters  must'  soon,  however,  tate  some  decisive  turn.  Ilnt,  in  the  mean  time,  we  cannot  understand  why  those  who  .have  invested  money  - STYLE=superscript  in  'Goverhinent  Stocks  or  Shares  for  income,  should  become  sellers,  under  the  present  circum circumstances  stances circumstances  of  the  country.  If  war  should  grow  out  of  ministerial  procrastination,  4 STYLE=superscript  161'8  is  no  room  for  supposing  that  it  wbiild  be  prolOnged  .  for  such  length  'of  tine,  as  would  be  likely  to  endanger  the  Dunctual  payment  of  the  dividends  on  the  public  debt.  Such  •an  event  cannot  by  :any  possi possibility  bility possibility  occur.  Where,  then,  is  the  cause  for  sacri sacrificing  ficing sacrificing  Government  Stocks  it§  they  haVe  been  sa sacrificed  crificed sacrificed  within  the  141  thWe  Months  ?

On  the  contrary,-  we  think  that,  war  would,  most  likely;  give  a  fresh,  impetus  to  trade  in  those  quarters.  The  prices  in  this  market  are  so  variable,  that  we  can  only  refer  otir  readers  to  the  ordinary  quotations,  Which  we  give  in  ano another  ther another  column,  Mao  are  how  about  53  vessels  entered  out  for  loading  at  Liverpool  for  the  Australian  colonies,  of  an  aggregate  of  about  33,000'  ton,  advertised  to  sail  in  the  - STYLE=superscript  eourse  of  the  present  month.  It  is,  however,  probable  that  the  destination  of  many  of  those,  and  some  of  the  116  laid  on  in  London,  will  be  changed,  since  the  receipt  of  the  information  that  the  AustraliaU  markets  are  glutted,  for  the  present,  with  goods  of  all  kinds.  .
