HAUSBURG,  24,  CHURCH-STREET  F.nL,  EL,  with  the  view  of  CURTAILING  SOME  OP  THE  BRANCHES  OP  His  BUSINESS,  has  decided  upon  DISPOSING  of  his  Stock  of  CHANDELIERS  FOR  GAS,  OIL,  &amp;c.,  and  begs  to  inform  his  Friends  and  the  Public,  that  the  Stock  has  not  only  been  completely  reassorted,  but  the  whole  of  the  prices  have  been  very  considerably  reduced,  thereby  offering  every  possible  inducement  to  give  him  the  preference  in  selection.  Articles  of  the  best  manufacture  have  been  marked  at  prices  so  low,  that  those  of  the  most  inferior  description  could  not  be  purchased  at  the  same  rate,  even  by  wholesale.  F.  L.  H.  would  refer  to  the  following,  namely:—  £  s.  d.  Three.light  Gas  Chandelier,  to  slide,  without  fittings.  1  10  o  Three-light  ..

AUREOLE  LAMPS.  The  arrivals  for  ti.e  Season  have  just  been  received,  combining  every  variety  from  the  Plainest  to  the  most  Ornamental,  and  all  at  the  most  moderate  prices,  namely  :  Complete,  with  the  best  mechanism  and  all  the  latest  improve improvements,  ments, improvements,  with  ()lobe,  Chimney,  and  Cottons,  At  155.,  18s.  6d.,:255„  285.,  to  .4  .

A  large  Stnk  of  PURE  COLZA  OIL,  IMPORTED  DIRECT  PROM  THE  CONTINENT,  kept  entirely  for  the  accommodation  of  F.  L.  H.'s  Customers,  as  pure.  unadulterated  Oil  cannot  be  obtained  in  the  English  market.  The  Aureole  Lamp  having  entirely  superseded  the  Sular  Lamp  in  England,  F.  L.

The  Lamps  will  be  offered  IN  LOTS,  FOR  SHIPMENT,  CONSIDERABLY  BELOW  THE  ACTUAL  COST.  and  all  the  Fittings  which  may  be  required,  at  Wholesale  Cost  Prices.  F.  L.  H.  takes  the  opportunity  of  stating,  that  those  Persons  wh  , STYLE=superscript  may  hitherto  have  beun  deterred  from  visiting  his  Establishment,  by  its  great  extent  and  the  valuable  Collection  of  Goods,  are  not  aware  that,  by  overcoming  this  impression,  (in  reality  a  prejudice,)  the  result  would  be  most  advantageous  to  them,  as  they  would  find  that  they  can  purchase  Articles  of  a  b.  tter  quality,  and  at  Lower  Prices.  than  at  any  other  Establishment.  He  considers  it  almost  superfluous  to  add,  that,  whether  they  make  Purchases  or  other otherwise,  wise, otherwise,  they  will,  in  every  case,  be  received  with  politeness  and  atten.  tion.
