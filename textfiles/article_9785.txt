"W.  H.  Jones,  and  many  others  ;  and  Roche  ;  notwithstanding  that  here  were  several  other  meeting  of  rc  other  parts  of  the  town  chair  was  taken  by  S.  Cropper,  Esq  ;ions  denominations  half-past  six  o'clock  the  g  was  opened  by  a  suitable  prayer  by  the  Rev.  The  Chairman,  in  introducing  the'  objects  of  the  meeting,  said,  they  had  met  together  on  another  of  those  interesting  occasions,  when  the  committee  have  to  give  an  account  of  what  they  had  don(  past  year,  bn  was  most  happy  to  say  '  that  they  had  a  most  satisfactory  account  to  render,  which  he  thought  should  fill  their  hearts  with  gladness.  During  the  past  year  there  had  been  nothing  to  retard  the  progress  of  the  mission—none  of  its  agents  had  suffered  from  illness,  or  any  sort  of  disease.  They  had  also  been  enabled  to  carry  on  the  working  of  the  mission,  as  they  had  had  sufficient  funds.  It  was  true  that  at  times  the  funds  have  on  some  occasions  been  low,  but  whenever  they  did  require  them  God  had  found  means  to  provide  them,  which  was  a  pleasing  feature  in  the  mission.  He  would  not  detain  them  with  any  further  observations,  but  would  call  upon  the  secretary  to  read  the  annual  report.  Mr.  W.  H.  Jones  then  came  forward  and  read  the  report,  which  was  a  very  long  but  interesting  document,  from  which  we  glean  the  following  facts  as  appertaining  to  this  mission.  During  the  past  year  many  changes  had  taken  place  in  the  agents.  At  its  commencement  they  had  24,  and  through  the  kindness  of  the  subscribers  they  had  aug augmented  mented augmented  that  number  to  27,  but  from  various  causes  they  had  lost  the  services  of  four  of  their  old  agents,  so  that  this  year  they  had  only  twenty-three  agents  ;  but  some  we-e  then  under  examination,  for  whom  a  selection  would  be  made.  The  report  then,  in  feeling  language,  regretted  the  deaths  of  Mr.  Blackburne  and  Mr.  Mancroft,  who  were  great  supporters  of  the  mission,  and  whose  loss  will  be  much  felt.  During  the  past  year,  the  agents  of  the  mission  had  paid  no  less  than  61,979  visits  to  the  dwellings  of  the  poor,  for  the  purpose  of  giving  religious  instructions  to  that  class,  who  most  required  it  ;  11,865  special  visits  to  the  sick  ;  and  359  visits  to  the  death-beds  of  the  poor.  In  the  course  of  the  year,  the  agents  had  held  3,252  in-door  meetings,  which  were  attended  by  the  aggregate  numbers  of  17,102  persons  ,  being  an  average  of  33  to  each  meeting  ;  they  had  also  held  343  out-door  meetings,  which  had  been  attended  by  at  least  57,303,  or  167  at  each  meeting;  they  had  also  distributed  142,722  tracts,  and  2,200  books,  which  it  was  hoped  would  be  read  by  a  large  portion  of  the  poor,  and  thus  have  a  tendency  to  check  the  spread  of  profane  and  immoral  works,  which  were  chiefly  found  in  such  loca localities.  lities. localities.  The  report  then  went  on  to  give  extracts  from  the  agents  accounts  of  the  visits  they  had  made,  and  the  general  aspect  of  the  progress  the  mission  bad  made,  and  the  work  vet  to  be  done,  and  calling  upon  all  those  who  had  the  well  being  of  the  poor  and  ignorant  at  heart,  to  come  forward  and  support  the  mission,  by  which  much  good  would  be  accomplished.  -  _  The  treasurer,  Mr.  Horton,  then  read  the  statement  of  accounts  for  the  past  year,  from  which  it  appeared  that  the  expenditure  had  been  £1,871  18s.  4i.,  while  the  income  had  been  £1,793  17s.  4ad.,  but  with  the  balance  they  bad  in  band  at  the  commencement  of  the  year,  would  leave  them  a  balance  on  the  31st  December,  1855,  of  £156  4s.  7d.  The  Rev.W.  Falloon,  in  the  course  of  a  most  impressive  address,  during  which  he  ably  commented  on  the  report,  pointed  out  the  great  advantages  derivable:  from  the  mis-  sion,  He  concluded  by  earnestly  exhorting  his  hearers  not  to  be  discouraged  by  the  difficulties  they  might  have.to  con contend  tend contend  against,  but  to  go  on  in  their  great  and  good  work— workthat  that workthat  of  saving  the  souls  of  those  who  might  otherwise  be  neglected  and  lost.  To  this  mission,  which  had  accom accomplished  plished accomplished  so  much  good,  and  which,  if  supported  as  it  should  be,  would  do  yet  more,  he  and  ail  Christians  wished  them  God's  speed.  He  concluded  by  moving  that  the  report  be  printed  and  circulated.  .  _  The  Rev.  Mr.  Taylor,  of  Bootle,  seconded  the  motion.'  The  Rev.  Mr.  Lowe  then  tnoved  the  second  plution.  He  argued  that,  in  giving  sunport  to  such  an  institution,  all  religious  differences  should  be  put  on  one  side,  and  that  all  should  do  their  utmost  to  give  effect  to  such  an  under-  taking.  Several  other  gentlemen  addressed  the  meeting,  in  the  course  of  which  they  ably  advocated  the  claims  the  mission  had  upon  the  public.  A  c  . STYLE=superscript  ollection  - STYLE=superscript  was  made  and  liberally  responded  to,  after  which,  the  meeting  closed  with  a  prayer.

COURT  OF  QUEEN'S  BENCH,  WESTMINSTER.  MOTION  TO  REMOVE  THE  TRIAL,  Yesterday.  before  the  full  court,  Mr.  Sergeant  Wilkins,  on  behalf  of  William  Palmer,  a  prisoner,  moved  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  to  bring  up  the  inquisitions  and  depositions  which  had  been  taken  in  the  cases  in  which  his  client  was  involved,  with  a  view  hereafter  to  a  trial  at  bar,  or  to  move  the  ve.tue  to  any  other  county  than  the  county  of  Stafford.  The  learned  sergeant  moved  upon  and  read  the  affidavits  of  the  accused  William  Palmer,  on  which  the  application  was  founded.  The  atfilavit,  which  was  volu voluminous,  minous, voluminous,  contained  the  following  p%ssage  I  am  informed,  and  believe,  that  I  cannot  have  a  fair  and  impartial  trial  in  the  county  of  Stafford,  or  in  fact  elsewhere  in  the  mid midland  land midland  c,unties,  inasmuch  as  the  prejudice  against  me  is  so  great,  that  I  do  not  believe,  amongst  an  ordinary  panel  of  jurymen,  any  twelve  men  could  be  found  unbiassed,  and  Lord  Campbell  observed  that  the  writs  of  certiorari  now  moved  for  could  not  possibly  bring  tho  inquisitions  before  the  court,  so  that  the  court  might  make  an  order  upon  them  in  the  course  of  the  present  term.  The  indictments  would  not  be  presented,  nor  could  they  be  found,  until  the  ensuing  assizes  at  Stafford,  and  until  they  were  fo:lnd  it  was  clear  that  the  court  could  make  no  order.  The  learned  serjeant  might,  however,  take  a  rule,  which,  with  the  affidavits,  might  be  served  upon  the  attoruies  in  the  c  )untry,  and  upon  the  coroner,  that  night,  if  great  efforts  were  made  to  accomplish  their  serve,  Mr.  Smith,  and  Mr.  George  Palmer,  the  brother  of  the  accused  William  Palmer,  then  hastened  t.)  adopt  the  necessary  steps,  for  the  service  of  the  rule  and  affidavits,  upon  the  various  parties  concerned  at  Rugeley,  and  Stafford.  The  subject  will,  in  all  probability,  come  before  the  court  again  to-morrow,  which  is  the  last  day  of  term.
