"NTRAL  AMIITCA  T3ELIZE,  FfolqDilltAg,  SEPTi  hererith  tend  you  an  account  of  the  recent  attack  made  by  tW4Ve  Spaniards  on  the  English  ..mahocrany  cutting  set=  tleinent  at  Unlit's,  near  'Truxia  in  Honduras.  This  account  was  lier  Bri-  tish  Majesty'  Vice  Consul,  the  Musquito  Governor,  Collector  of  Customs,  &amp;c.,  at  Limas  ;  and,  as  he  was  there  himself,  I  shall  make  no  remarks,-save  that  the  government  of  Honduras  entirely  disavo%  hating'  any  hand  in  tile  Matter,  and  were  bandit  27  the  men  The  war  bet  Ween  Honduras  and  Guatemala  has  been  for  the  last  fourâ€¢  weeks  pushed  with_  consi considerable  derable considerable  energy  by  the  State  of  Guatemala,  they  hating  sent  an  agent  to  Bplize,  bought  the  schooner  Eliza  and  Susan  ;  fitted  her  out  as  a  man  of  war,  and  with  her,  captured  the  towns  of  Omoa  and  Truzillo.  Thus  Guatemala  has  made  herself  mas master  ter master  of  all  the  sea  coast  of  Honduras  in  this  gulf,  and  given  herself  an  immense  advantage  over  that  State,  as  at  those  two  ports,  she  formerly  had  con considerable  siderable considerable  trade  with  this  town,  New  Orleans,  New  York  and  Boston.  This  new  movement  on  the  part  of  Guatemala,  it  is  thought,  will  place  the  in-.  terests  of  the  English  mahogany  cutters  on  a  more  favourable  footing  in  that  quarter.  lii  Belize,  business  is  very  good,  the  flood  having  brought  down  the  mahogany  cut  last  year,  which  wood  is  now  being  manufactured,  giving  employ employment  ment employment  to  all  the  labourers,  and  new  life  and  activity  to  the  town  trade.  Mahogany  and  logwood  is  very  high  here,  and  is  bringing  extra  prices  in  England  and  New  York."
