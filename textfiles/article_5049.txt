"GROWTH  OF  CANADA.  It  affords  us  pleasure  to  say  that  from  official  statements  now  before  us,  the  mercantile  prosperity  of  Canada  is  greatly  on  the  increase.  From  what  we  have  seen  in  passing  from  Quebec  to  almost  its  western  limits,  we  were  prepared  to  be believe  lieve believe  that  the  last  year's  importations  were  greatly  in  ad advance  vance advance  of  any  former  year;  but  we  were  not  prepared  for  the  fact  that  m  Upper  Canada  the  increase  of  population  was  larger  than  that  of  the  United  States.  Yet  the  census  of  both  countries  shows  it  to  be  the  fact,  as  will  be  seen  by  an  extract  given  below.  As  it  regards  the  commerce  of  C  ana  d  a  ,  we  l  earn  f  rom  th  e  Montreal  Herald,  that  the  importations  of  dry  goods  have  exceeded  in  value  those  of  the  corresponding  period  of  last  year  by  $2,106,108;  of  hardware,  $904,304;  of  teas,  $92,152;  sugars,  $44,196.  The  census  reports,  made  up  to  the  commencement  of  the  present  year,  have  just  been  published.  The  Toronto  Leader  gives  the  synopsis  of  its  contents.  The  census  tables  ,furnish  some  valuable  :  information  on  the  comparative  increase  of  th  e  diff  eren  t  nationalities  in  Lower  Canada.  The  comparison  embraces  the  period  be between  tween between  the  census  of  1844  and  that  of  1851.  The  greatest  increase  has  taken  place  in  Canadians  of  British  origin  ;  being  46,63  per  cent.  against  27.69  in  the  French  Canadians.  The  next  highest  on  the  list,  English  and  Welsh,  5.59  ;  Scotch,  8.81;  17.12,  and  United  States,  4.59.  The  means  of  carrying  on  the  comparison  does  not  exist.  In  addition  to  the  origins  named,  there  is  a  sprinkling  of  Nova  Scotians,  New  Brunswickers,  Newfoundlanders,  Germans,  and  Dutch,  French  and  others  of  which  L  the  enumerators  obtained  no  particulars.  In  Upper  Canada  there  is  even  a  greater  variety  of  nation nationalities.  alities. nationalities.  But  in  this  respect  neither  Canada  nor  the  United  States  is  singular.  Emigration  brings  its  varieties  of  nationalities;  but  after  all  they  are  not  greater  than  to  be  found  in  many  countries  in  Europe.  There  is,  however,  this  difference  between  Canada  and  Europe,  that  in  the  latter  the  distinct  people  often  settle  down  by  themselves  in  clans,  whereas  here  everything,  especially  in  Upper  Canada,  tends  to  assimilation.  The  Russian  population  comprises  Scy Scythians,  thians, Scythians,  Huns,  Massagates,  Slavians,  Cimbrians,  Getes,  and  Sarmatians.  These  different  people  hav  e  un  it  e  d  a  t  different  times,  under  the  same  government  ;  but  amalgamation,  under  such  circumstances,  is  much  more  difficult  than  where  the  process  of  fusion  is  carried  on  with  the  emigration.  That  people  which  we  now  designate  by  the  general  term  French,  comprises  Goths,  Danes  or  Normans,  13urgundians,  from  Northern  Germany,  Franks,  Allemans,  and  some  Romans  mixed  with  the  ancient  Celtic.  In  Rome  and  Italy  are  to  be  found  people  from  the  north  ;  but  it  is  doubtfiil  if  there  be  any  ancient  Romans.  But  such  is  the  mixture  of  peoples  that  the  Pope  is  sometimes  the  descendant  of  a  Lombard,  sometimes  of  a  Goth,  a  Teuton  or  a  Cimbrian.  The  sources  of  the  Spanish  race  are  Arabs,  Carthagenians,  Jews,  Syrians,  Visi,goths  and  Vandals.  The  time  will  doubtless  come  when  the  entire  population  of  Canada,  Upper  and  Lower,  will  be  a  more  homogeneous  Teople  than  any  of  those  European  countries  are  to-day.  he  French  race  in  Lower  Canada  will  struggle  against  the  extinction  to  which  all  races  in  this  situation  are  inevitably  doomed  ;  but  the  struggle  will  be  a  bootless  one.  The  example  of  Louisiana,  a  French  colony,  purchased  from  Napoleon,  in  1802,  shows  how  rapid  may  be  the  absorption  of  a  race  under  certain  circumstances.  Half  a  century  ago  Louisiana  was  a  French  colony,  with  a  French  population.  That  people  has  now  lost  many  of  the  distinct  characteristics  of  its  nationality;  and  in  half  a  century  more  will  be  completely  merged  in  the  general  mass  of  the  population.  In  Lower  Canada  the  process  is  slower,  but  the  result  must  eventually  be  the  same.  When  Lower  Canada  ceased  to  be  a  French  colony,  it  lost  at  once  and  for  ever  that  French  emigration  which  had  founded  the  colony.  The  remnant  of  a  French  colony,  deprived  of  all  accessions  from  extraneous  sources,  and  dependent  only  on  the  natural  means  of  increase,  cannot  hold  its  own  against  a  rival  race,  who,  to  the  natural  means  of  increase,  add  the  advantage  of  constant  accretions  from  immigration.  The  comparative  increase  of  the  religious  denominations  is  given.  In  the  period  from  1842  to  1851  the  Church  of  England  in  Upper  Canada  increased  73.13  per  cent.:  and  the  Church  of  Scotland  decreased  38.32,  the  Church  of  Rome  increased  114  61,  the  Presbyterians  of  all  kinds  the  enor enormous  mous enormous  amount  of  572.38,  the  Wesleyan  Methodists  45,  the  Episcopal  Methodists  82,  other  Methodists  not  specified  600,  the  Baptists  131,  the  Lutherans  123.54,  the  Congregation Congregationalists  alists Congregationalists  53,  and  the  Menonists  and  Tunkers  73.68.  Such  has  been  the  respective  increase  of  the  various  denominations  in  Upper  Canada,  during  a  period  of  nine  years.  In  Lower  Canada  the  period  of  comparison  is  from  1844  to  1851.  The  Roman  Catholics  increased  30.42,  the  Church  of  England  4.31,  the  Church  of  Scotland  85,  the  Wesleyan  Methodists  58,  other  Methodists  not  particularised  816,  Presbyterians  465.55.  Among  the  minor  denominations  the  comparison  is  not  carried  out.  During  the  last  ten  years  covered  by  the  census,  the  popu population  lation population  of  Upper  Canada  increased  1041  per  cent.  At  this  iato  tt  mnrn  than  amihleg  every  ten  years.  This  far  out outstrips  strips outstrips  the  progress  of  the  United  States,  which  from  1840  to  1850,  increased  only  66.66  per  cent.,  and  is  over  ten  times  as  great  as  that  of  England  and  Scotland.  England  doubled  in  the  first  half  of  this  century,  Scotland  did  not  mite  double.  At  the  commencement  of  the  century  the  population  of  Scot Scotland  land Scotland  was  1,608,420,  and  in  1851  it  was  only  2,888,742.  It  was  to  be  expected  that  the  progress  in  population  of  Upper  Canada  would  outstrip  that  of  'old  densely  populated  coun countries  tries countries  like  England  and  Scotland,  but  that  for  a  period  of  ten  years,  the  increase  should  stand  for  Canada  1044,  and  for  the  United  States  but  66.66  is  what  few  would  be  prepared  for.  If  Upper  Canada  had  950,000  inhabitants  at  the  commencement  of  1851,  she  will,  at  the  rate  of  increase  made  in  the  previous  ten  years,  have  a  population  of  over  2,050,000  in  1861,  and  at  the  conclusion  of  the  next  ten  years,  that  is  1871,  the  population  would  be  4,225,000.

DOMESTICS  AT  SAN  FRANCISCO.--A  late  letter  says  :—Our  community  aro  suffering  for  the  want  of  good  female  help.  Servants  of  all  kinds  continue  to  command  large  wages,—and  are  difficult  to  be  had  at  any  price.  Seamstresses  get  $5  per  day,  and  job  work  in  proportion.  Female  cooks  and  waiters,  nurses,  and  those  adapted  to  general  housework,  readily  get  from  $5O  to  $75  per  month  wages,  and  that  too,  in  families  of  respectability,  where  they  are  sure  to  be  well  treated  and  find  a  good  home.  Common  day  labourers,  hod hodcarders,  carders, hodcarders,  and  the  like,  get  $5  to  $6  per  day.  Carpenters,  maEons,  and  the  like,  $lO  to  $l2  per  day,  while  their  board  costs  them  only  $8  to  $lO  per  week.  Washing  $3  per  dozen,  stereotype  price.  INCENDIARISM  IN  THE  WEST.  —On  Saturday  night  a  fire  was  discovered  in  some  outbuildings  on  Southey  Farm,  near  Culmstock,  in  the  county  of  Devon,  in  the  occupation  of  Mr.  John  Geare,  and  belonging  to  Mr.  J.  Heathcoat,  M.P.  for  Tiverton.  The  fire  soon  spread  to  the  dwelling-house  adjoining,  and  in  less  than  an  hour,  such  was  the  fury  of  the  flames,  the  house,  the  barn,  stabling,  cow  shed,  &amp;c.,  were  burnt  to  the  ground.  A  hayrick,  the  produce  of  eighteen  acres  of  land,  and  worth  501.,  a  thrashing  and  winnowing  machine,  and  a  variety  of  agricultural  implements,  besides  fifty  bushels  of  barley,  and  a  large  quantity  of  straw,  were  destroyed.  The  premises  were  only  partially  insured,  and  the  tenant  has  lost  3001.  of  property.  It  is  generally  supposed  that  the  fire  was  the  work  of  an  incendiary,  and,  as  this  if  the  third  that  has  occurred  in  that  neighbourhood,  it  is  hoped  that  active  measures  will  be  taken  to  bring  the  miscreants  to  justice.  The  rural  police  are  on  the  alert.  VOTES  FOR  SUPERIOR  OPERATIVES.—There  is  another  class  of  operatives  whose  superiority  and  consequent  fitness  for  the  franchise  is  incontestably  proved,  and  whom  the  savings-bank  qualification  would  not  always  reach—those,  namely,  who  are  placed  in  authority  over  others.  Such  are  overlookers  in  factories  and  mines,  foremen  and  heads  of  departments  in  iron  foundries  and  machine-making  establish establishments,  ments, establishments,  head  gardeners  who  have  labourers  under  them,  and  others  in  similar  positions.  All  who  are  thus  appointed  to  situtions  of  command  have  been  selected  in  virtue  of  superior  capacity,  steadness,  integrity,  or  education,  and  must,  in  order  to  have  attained  such  situations,  have  given  proof  of  mental  or  moral  qualifications  above  those  of  the  mass  of  their  fellow-workmen.  They  are  precisely  the  class  whom  we  desire  to  discriminate  from  the  rest;  who,  as  leaders,  are  likely,  to  influence  other,  and  whose  opinion  on  public  questions  and  men  it  would  be  really  valuable  to  know.  —Edinburgh  Review.  NEW  ZEALAND  FLAX.—The  council  have  received  from  the  New  Zealand  Society  the  one  ton  of  Phormium  Tenax,  or  New  Zeal_.  :1.1  flax,  mentioned  in  a  previous  of  the  Journal,  which  has  been  cleansed  in  rather  an  inferior  manner  to  the  usual  mode,  and  has  had  much  less  labour  bestowed  upon  it  than  native-dressed  flax.  The  object  of  Chu  Now  Zoal,nd  Soeisty  in  sending  this  sample  is  to  enable  experiments  to  be  made,  with  a  view  to  the  introduction  and  application  of  such  machinery  and  pro processes  cesses processes  as  might  lead  to  improvements  in  the  preparation  of  the  flax,  so  as  to  render  it  fit  for  exportation.  The  New  Zealand  Society  has  placed  in  the  hands  of  the  council  a  draft  for  50  guineas,  which  they  are  willing  should  be  awarded  to  any  person  who  will  furnish  them  with  modes  of  operation,  models  and  specifications  of  machinery,  by  which  the  flax  may  be  dressed  at  a  cost  not  exceeding  £5  per  ton  (this  price  to  prepare  the  flax  as  a  raw  material,)  reckoning  the  wages  of  an  ordinary  labourer  at  4s.  per  diem,  and  of  artisans  at  Gs  to  6s  6d.  The  machine  to  be  of  two  kinds  ;  one  analagous  to  the  old  spinning  wheel,  that  may  be  used  in  every  cottage  or  shepherd's  hut,  and  the  other  suitable  for  more  extensive  operations.—Tournal  of  the  Society  of  Arts.  IRISH  POUTS  IRISH  ENTERPRISE  —At  a  recent  meet meeting'  ing' meeting'  of  the  shareholders  of  the  Waterford  and  Kilkenny  railway  it  was  stated  that  the  directors  mean  to  apply  next  session  to  extend  their  line  to  Maryboro'  and  Ros Roscrea  crea Roscrea  and  the  following  statement  respecting  the  consequences  to  Waterford  of  the  non-existence  of  railway  communica communication  tion communication  with  the  districts  surrounding  it  was  made.  The  traffic  on  the  line  at  the  present  time  has  not  equalled  the  expec expectations  tations expectations  of  the  directors.  This  is  chiefly  owing  to  the  present  terminus  at  Dunkitt  being  upwards  of  two  miles  from  the  city  of  Waterford,  and  also  to  the  great  want  of  more  fre frequent  quent frequent  steam  communication  between  Waterford,  Liver Liverpool,  pool, Liverpool,  and  Bristol,  and  to  the  length  of  time  the  district  was  without  the  advantage  of  railways,  the  result  of  which  bas  been  that  the  agricultural  and  other  produce  which  would  have  been  taken  to  Waterford  for  shipment  has  been  drawn  away  to  Dublin.  The  imports  and  exports  of  Waterford  in  1835,  amounted  only  to  248,000  tons  ;  in  1851  they  had  decreased  to  237,000  ;  whereas  those  of  Dublin,  which,  in  1835,  amounted  only  to  590,000  tons,  had  in  1851  increased  to  1,397,000  tons;  and  since  that  time  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  the  returns  from  Dublin  have  been  much  larger,  while  those  from  Waterford  have  continued  to  decrease.  It  has  recently  been  determined  by  influential  persons  at  Waterford  to  construct  a  line  of  railway  to  the  packet-sta packet-station  tion packet-station  at  Dunmore,  from  which  regular  steam  communication  will  be  kept  up  with  the  port  of  Milford-haven,  to  which  place  the  South  Wales  railway  is  now  nearly  completed  ;  and  it  is  intended  to  run  an  increased  number  of  steam steamvessels  vessels steamvessels  to  and  from  Bristol  and  Liverpool,  so  that  Water Waterford  ford Waterford  may  again  become  the  principal  shipping  port  for  the  produce  of  and  the  supplies  to  the  south-east  of  Ireland."
