How  then,  we  repeat,  can  the  weekly  returns  of  the  Bank  of  England  be  taken  as  an  index  to  the  monetary  or  commercial  operations  of  the  country.  The  returns  of  the  Bank's  position  if  taken  alone,  are  enough  to  cause  the  utmost  un uneasiness  easiness uneasiness  in  the  public  mind  ;  but,  when  coupled  with  the  movements  of  bullion  in  our  market,  they  exhibit  a  degree  of  national  prosperity  which  is  most  encouraging,  and  to  show  the  actual  change  that  has  taken  place  in  the  Banking  and  Monetary  condition  of  the  country,  we  have  prepared  the  fol following  lowing following  statement  :  Increase  in  Bullion  held  by  the  Bank  of  England  for  four  weeks,  ending  Nov.  19.  .  .  £548,673  Excess  of  Imports  of  Gold  over  amount  received  by  Bank  of  England  for  four  weeks,  ending  Nov.  19.  .  .  881,127  £1,429,800  Here,  then,  we  find  the  increase  in  our  bullion  power  in  one  month  is  equal  to  £1,429,800,  and  that  out  of  this  sum  a  little  more  than  one-third  appears  to  be  accounted  for  in  the  bank  returns.  Hence  we  naturally  ask  :  where  has  the  large  amount  of  £881,127  gone  ?  In  answer  to  this  inquiry,  we  are  told  that  emigration  and  an  increased  demand  among  gold  and  silver  workers  will  account  for  a  large  absorption  of  the  precious  metals.  With  regard  to  emigration,  every  one  is  aware  that  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  emigrants  sailing  from  Great  Britain  are  poor  Irish  people,  who  are  taken  away  by  foreign  drafts  or  money  sent  home  from  other  countries  by  their  friends;  and  that  the  money  so  sent  is  immediately  paid  to  some  shipping  agent,  and  by  the  latter  to  his  banker,  where  it  at  once  becomes  traceable  in  cur  ordinary  banking  returns.  Let  us,  however,  assume  for  a  moment,  that  300,000  emigrants  leave  this  country  *The  Chaplain  of  the  Preston  House  of  Correction,  estimates  the  loss  caused  to  the  public  by  15  pickpockets,  whose  career  he  had  traced,  including  the  value  of  the  property  stolen,  expenses  of  prosecution,  and  maintenance  in  gaol,  at  L  26,6004"
