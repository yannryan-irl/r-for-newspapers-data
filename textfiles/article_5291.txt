Unem Unemployed  ployed Unemployed  notes,  decrease,  510,1551,  At  the  Liverpool  Corn  Market  we  had  an  average  attendance  of  buyers  to-day.  The  Grain  trade  has  been  quiet  the  last  few  days,  and  where  sales  of  Wheat  and  Flour  have  been  pressed  from  the  ship,  lower  rates  have  had  to  be  submitted  to,  yet  more  disposition  was  manifest  to  take  large  lots  of  Wheat  and  Flour,  to  hold  over,  by  importers  yield yielding  ing yielding  in  price.  The  market  closed  with  more  strength  than  was  anticipated,  and  the  reduction  from  Tuesday  last  may  be  called  ld.  to  2d.  per  bushel  on  Wheat,  and  6d.  to  9d.  per  barrel  on  Flour.  Indian  corn  without  demand  and  the  price  nomi nominal.  nal. nominal.  Oats  and  Oatmeal  each  easier.  In  Barley,  Beans,  and.  Peas  no  change.  The  Gazette  returns  of  sales  of  British  Wheat  this  week  are  70,629  qrs.,  at  70s.  2d.  per  qr.  ;  corresponding  week  last  year,  94,301  qrs.,  at  455.  sd.  per  qr.  Our  Wool  Market  for  the  month  has  been  quiet,  •but  firm.  The  unusually  large  quantities  of  vari  ous  kinds  introduced  at  public  sales,  here  and  in  London  of  late,  have  had  a  depressing  effect  upon  the  market,  and  lowered  the  value  generally  ;  since  those  sales  have  terminated,  more  inquiry  is  apparent,  more  business  has  been  transacted,  and  in  many  instances  at  advanced  prices.  No  auction  sales  were  held  last  month,  and  the  contracts  are  all  by  private  treaty.  Sales,  though  only  moderate,  have  been  made  i.i  long  coarse  Bosnia,  Oporto  fleece  and  lambs,  2Jruvian,  Russian  fleece,  Buenos  Ayres,  East  Indian,  Chilian,  Turkey,  &amp;c.,  at  fair  prices.  For  Russian  combing  there  is  a  fair  de demand,  mand, demand,  and  for  the  better  elasses  of  Turkey  free  from  scurff.  Oporto  lambs  are  held  for  such  extreme  rates,  that  only  small  sales  are  effected.  East  India  is  moving  off  pretty  freely,  at  rather  better  value.  Scotch—Laid  Highland  is  firmly  held  for  rates  though  some  few  parcels.  have  been  disposed  of  at  a  slight  reduction,  a  parcel,or  two  of  laid  washed,  very  light,  is  recorded  at  a  reduction  of  ls.  per  241bs.  ;  cheviot  both  laid  and  washed,  has  been  quiet,  cross  is  dull,  but  a  little  selling  ;  laid  Gallo Galloway  way Galloway  is  asked  for,  and  offers  of  ls.  per  241b5.,  under  recent  value,  firmly  refused  ;  not  much  doing  in  white  Highland,  to  effect  sales,  prices  must  be  in  favour  of  the  buyers.  English  and  Irish.—A  few  lots  of  fleeces  have  changed  hands,  and  the  stock  here  is  much  reduced  ;  for  bright  haired  sorts  there  is  some  improvement,  in  Yorkshire  an  advance  of  id.  per  lb.  has  been  realised,  for  deep  combing  descriptions,  and  large  holders  don't  feel  inclined  to  sell.  In  the  country  the  quantity  in  the  grower's  possession  is  light,  for  which  higher  prices  are  generally  demanded,  than  what  fleeces  can  be  procured  for,  in  staplers'  hands.  In  the  Liverpool  Cotton  Market,  there  has  been  a  fair  demand  during  the  week,  with  an  increased  demand  both  for  speculation  and  export;  and  we  find  that  the  consumption  from  this  port,  judging  by  the  average  of  the  last  few  weeks,  must  be  about  32,000  bales  weekly.  Brazils  are  in  fair  request,  but  offered  freely  and  therefore  a  little  heavy.  In  Egyptians  a  fair  extent  of  business  has  been  done,  and  no  improvement  whatever  in  prices.  We  still  have  a  good  demand  for  Surats.  5300  bales  Ame American,  rican, American,  70  Egyptian,  2630  Surat,  700  Madras,  and  370  Bengal  have  been  taken  on  speculation  and  for  export,  and  37,310  bales  by  the  trade.  The  actual  export  '  consists  of  790  American,  100  Brazils,  &amp;c.,  and  1160  East  India—in  all  2,050  bales.  The  sales  to-day  are  6,000  bales,  of  which  1,000  are  taken  on  speculation  and  for  export.  The  sales  during  last  month  amounted  to  185,850  bales,  of  which  40,990  were  reported  as  taken  on  speculation  and  for  export.  The  actual  exports  were  11,800  bales.  The  consumption  this  year-37,256  bales  weekly  against  an  actual  con consumption  sumption consumption  in  1852  of  85,790  bales  weekly,"
