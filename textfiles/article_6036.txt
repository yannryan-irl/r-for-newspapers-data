"ROCHDALE  MARKET.  -MONDAY,  DEC.  12.  We  have  had  but  a  thin  attendance  of  buyers  to-day,  who  have  shown  a  great  unwillingness  to  purchase  except  at  reduced  prices.  WooL  is  quite  as  firm  as  it  was  the  pre preceding  ceding preceding  week,  and  the  manufacturers  evince  no  disposition  to  buy  but  for  immediate  use.  HUDDERSFIELD  MARKET.â€”TUESDAY,  DEC.  13.  The  market  has  been  attended  by  very  few  buyers  to-day,  and  the  business  done  has  been  correspondingly  small.  At  this  particular  season  the  market  is  not  usually  brisk,  so  that  no  surprise  is  felt  at  the  slackness  of  the  demand.  Heavy  goods  for  winter  wear  are  what  are  mostly  inquired  for,  and  of  these  about  the  usual  quantity  is  selling.  Wool,  moves  oft'  slowly."
