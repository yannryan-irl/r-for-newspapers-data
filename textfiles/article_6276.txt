THIS  DAY—Morning,  lh.  46m  ....  Afternoon,  2h.  Ow.  TUESDAY,  DECEMBER  20,  1853  THE  President  of  the  United  States  message  conies  to  us  as  a  great  and  comprehensive  treatise  on  the  progress  of  civilisation.  It  first  glances  at  the  substantive  condition  of  other  countries  and  then  goes  on  to  shape  the  political  course  of  the  States  so  as  to  regulate  and  supply  the  great  national  wants  of  their  own  people.  In  dealing  with  the  political  relations  of  the  States  at  home  and  abroad,  it  does  so  without  secrecy  or  reserve.  And  while  it  leaves  little  for  the  future  historian  to  do,  it  leaves  absolutely  nothing  for  faction  to  cavil  about.  As  an  example  it  might  be  followed  to  great  advantage.  With  regard  to  the  diplomatic  relations  of  the  States  with  foreign  countries  the  message  informs  us  that  they  have  undergone  no  important  change,  while  it  points  to  some  of  rather  a  disturbing  chai  a3ter;  amongst  which  we  find  the  Fisheries  Central  American,  and  the  Canadian  Boundary  ques ques.4  .4 ques.4 STYLE=superscript  r  tions  whielztrvAtpresent  under  negotiation  between  &gt;4  ,  the  Goverittliats  of  England  and  the  States,  and  the  whole'arvZich  it  is  hoped  \\ill  be  satisfactorily  ,  , STYLE=superscript  41  ;7)  7  .4  t\  •  ),_•  „  A  1 STYLE=superscript  7  4  'de"
