"English,  which,  throng  bein  in  insuf  nt  supply  value;  common  have  also  participated  in  the  improvement,  although  not  to  the  smile  Went,  The  continued  advance  in  hides,  and  great  uncertainty  as  to  caused  tanners  to  keep  their  leather  off  the  mar  Lure  supplies,  have  oned,  stool  as  possible,  before  me..  seen  exceedingly  light.  Having  referred  in  our  opening  paragraphs  to  the  causes  which  have  produced  the  present  standard  of  price  , STYLE=superscript  ,  and  to  the  effects  which  an  altered  state  of  political  events  may  produce,  we  have  little  more  to  add,  other  than  the  remark  that  the  year  commences  with  an  exceedingly  small  quantity  of  leather  in  factors'  hands,  tanners,  many  of  them,  are  full  of  orders,  and  that  i  estimated,  that  the  country  dealers  hold  exceedingly  small  stocks  ;  from  which  our  readers  miy  draw  th  ;ir  OWN  inference,  taking  into  consideration  the  other  circumstances  we  have  alluded  to.  DRESSING  LEATHER  :  Shaved  hides  have  improved  in  value  considerably,  and  are  now  2d  to  gd  per  lb  higher  than  at  the  commencement  of  last  year.  Government  orders  have  required  large  quantities,  and  the  market  has  been  frequently  cleared  ;  stocks  on  hand  are  exceedingly  small,  and  our  present  quotations  are  readily  obtained.  Harness  hides  have  also  advanced  in  price,  and  well  flayed  parcels  continue  to  be  much  wanted  ;  common  descriptions  are  more  plentiful  :  good  unshaved  dressing  hides  about  21  to  26113  s  are  in  request,  at  our  full  quotations.  Horse  hides,  the  stocks  on  hand  of  these  goods,  both  tanned  and  in  the  hair,  are  considerably  reduced,  but  we  cannot  report  much,  if  any,  improvement  in  value  ;  it  is  evident  that  the  consump consumption  tion consumption  of  Cordovan  in  this  country  has  fallen  off  very  materially.  Kips,  in  the  almost  absence  of  any  supplies  of  Petersburgh,  the  best  qualities  of  East  India  have  been  much  enquired  for;  common  qualities  have  continued  dull  of  sale  until  within  the  last  month,  when  a  better  demand  has  been  experienced.  Stocks  of  all  kinds  are  small,  and  fresh  arrivals  more  freely.  Calf  skins  have  sold  steadily  during  the  whole  of  the  year,  and  there  is  not  much  alt  era  ti  on  in  prices  to  note  ;  good  pattern  skins,  70  to  901bs,  are  much  sought  after.  OFFAL.—It  is  somewhat  remarkable  that  offal  is  almost  the  only  article  connected  with  the  trade  which  has  deterio deteriorated  rated deteriorated  in  value  during  the  past  year,  both  shoulders  and  bellies  being  Id  to  ld  per  lb  lower  than  at  this  time  twelve  months  back;  this  may  be  in  some  mea  s  u  re  accoun  t  e  d  f  or  by  the  decline  in  the  price  of  sizing  having  induced  tanners  to  tan  more  of  their  offal  than  they  otherwise  would  have  done.  At  the  present  time  shoulders,  both  English  and  Foreign,  are  not  in  large  supply,  but  the  stock  of  bellies  is  considerable.  There  appears  to  be  a  feeling  prevalent  that  there  will  be  a  move  in  offal  shortly,  in  conformity  to  the  present  state  of  the  market  for  other  descriptions  of  leather.  RAW  GOODS.—SALTED  RIVER  PLATE  AND  RIO  GRANDE  lIIDES.—On  reference  to  the  annexed  table,  it  will  be  seen  that  the  total  imports  into  this  country  for  the  past  year  have  been  568,342,  against  492,437  in  1854,  712,565  in  1853,  601.578  in  1852,  and  630,452  in  1851,  which  shows  a  decrease  of  40,916  hides  on  the  average  of  the  four  pre preceding  ceding preceding  years.  Of  the  import  this  year  a  very  considerable  deduction  must  be  made  for  the  large  quantity  which  has  been  taken  to  supply  government  orders,  and  which  have  not  come  into  tanners'  hands  ;  and  it  may  fairly  be  presumed  that  the  quantity  of  hides  put  into  work  in  this  country  during  the  past  twelve  months  has  been  very  much  below  the  average  of  many  years  back.  During  the  whole  of  the  past  year  the  market  for  these  goods  has  been  exceedingly  buoyant,  and  prices  have  continued  gradually  to  advance  without  any  check,  until  they  have  reached  our  present  quotations,  which  are  from  20  to  25  per  sent.  higher  than  at  this  period  in  1855.  This  advance  is  principally  owing  to  the  advices  from  time  to  time  reaching  this  country  from  the  River  Plate,  all  to  the  effect  that  there  were  few  hides  to  ship,  and  by  tanners  apprehending  (certainly  not  without  great  cause)  there  would  be  a  scarcity  of  leather  in  the  country  consequent.  upon  the  small  quantities  of  hides  put  forward  in  1854.  The  continental  markets  have  competed  largely  with  us  for  these  bides,  and  have  given  a  further  stimulus  to  prices  The  prospect  of  future  supplies  seems  very  unsatisfactory  by  the  lart  advices  from  the  River  Plate,  and  the  market  is  now  very  firm  at  our  extreme  quo'ations.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  present  high  rates  will  bring  over  all  the  hides  that  can  be  procured;  and  should  the  war  end  soon,  the  wants  of  Government  for  loshing  purposes  will  cease  ;  and  it  may  be  expected  that  the  continental  markets  will  require  a  much  less  quantity,  therefore  our  home  tanners  may  be  able  to  obtain  larger  supplies.  The  stocks  remaining  on  hand  at  the  present  time  are  exceedingly  small,  tho  total  quantity  in  the  United  Kingdom  being  only  7,978  hides,  against  37,032  at  the  end  of  1854;  114,231  in  1853;  63,258'in  1852  ;  and  144,336  in  1851.  Dux  RIVER  PLATE  AND  RIO  GRANDE  HIDES.—The  total  imiort  during  the  past  year  has  again  been  extremely  limited,  amounting  to  only  4,349,  of  both  descriptions,  against  7,171  in  1854,  64,625  in  1853,  24,185  in  1852,  and  62,653  in  1851.  With  this  small  import,  the  transactions  have  necessarily  been  unimportant,  but  prices  have  ruled  much  higher  than  for  many  years  back.  The  bulk  of  the  imports  have  been  of  common  quality.  The  present  stocks  on  hand  are  939  dry  Rio  Grande  in  this  market,  and  60  dry  Buenos  Ayres  in  London;  total  999  hides,  against  676  in  1854,  3,754  in  1853,  and  4,200  in  1852.  WEST  COAST  AND  WEST  INDIA  HlDES.—lmports  7,549  of  the  former,  and  7,483  of  the  latter,  against  12,003  of  both  kinds  in  1854,  and  6,451  in  1853.  A  brisk  demand  has  existed  for  these  hides,  and  they  in  common  with  other  raw  goods  have  advanced  in  price,  present  quotations  being  lid  to  2d  per  lb  higher  than  at  the  commencement  of  last  year.  Present  stock  only  81  west  coast  (in  London)  and•no  West  India,  against  2,211  i❑  1854.  BRAZIL  Hthis—we  have  received  a  large  supply  of  these  hides  during  the  past  year,  the  total  imports  being  98,849,  against  63,815  in  1854,  66,311  in  1853,  38,462  in  1852,  and  21,244  in  1851.  The  demand  has  been  good,  and  prices  have  advanced  with  little  intermission  during  the  whole  year,  to-day's  quotations  being  about  15  on  wet  salted,  and  2d  per  lb  on  dry  salted,  over  those  at  this  time  twelve  months  back.  Of  the  quantity  imported,  by  far  the  greater  portion  have  been  sold  for  export,  but  our  home  tanners  have  lately  taken  them  to  a  fair  extent.  Stock  on  hand  7,390,  against  5,240  in  1854,  and  6,580  in  1853.  EAST  INDIA  Kr  - STYLE=superscript  Ps—lmport  2,373,957,  against  2,339,371  in  1854,  2,135,524  in  1853,  and  1,666,000  in  1852.  The  imports  into  this  market  have  been  on  a  very  limited  scale,  and  principally  of  common  descriptions.  The  demand  has  ruled  dull  up  to  within  the  last  two  months,  when  more  inquiry  sprung  up  and  prices  advanced,  present  rates  being  higher  by  about  Id  per  lb  over  those  of  this  time  last  year.  Present  stock  this  market  30,000,  and  in  London  323,193,  total  353,193,  against  347,297  in  1854,  389,000  in  1853,  and  426,000  in  1852.  HORSE  HlDES.—lmports  180,294,  against  321,406,  in  1854,  358,052  in  1853,  and  121,255  in  1852.  At  the  early  part  of  the  year,  the  demand  was  exceedingly  languid,  and  prices  continued  to  rule  very  low  during  the  summer  months  ;  there  has  latterly,  however,  been  more  inquiry,  principally  for  export,  and  the  market  has  been  left  hare  of  stock;  our  present  quotations  are  2s  to  2s  6d  per  hide  higher  than  at  this  period  last  year.  The  stock  in  this  market  is  5,217,  and  in  London  22,648;  total  27,865,  against  93,855  in  1854,  69,021  in  1853,  9,940  in  1852,  and  61,004  in  1851.  Oak  BARK.—lmport,  into  this  market  4,500  tons,  against  3150  in  1854,  4,680  in  1853,  and  4,500  in  1852.  The  demand  has  been  pretty  constant  during  the  year  , STYLE=superscript  and  prices  were  somewhat  higher,  but  during  the  lasttw  i  n  o  a  rmonthsket  closes  se  the  s  arrivals  have  been  more  extensi  ve, STYLE=superscript  and  the  with  little  alteration  in  the  quotations  of  this  time  last  year;  our  home  harvest  has  been  large,  and  in  this  dis district  trict district  of  good  quality,  from  which  tanners  have  supplied  themselves  freely,  at  prices  rather  above  those  current  in  1854.  70  tons  cork  tree  bark  have  been  imported  -  sold  ex  ship  at  61.  15s.  per  ton.  —VALONIL—Import  4400  tons,  against  7600  in  1854,  6675  tons  in  1853,  and  5750  tons  in  1852.  The  import  is  small,  but,  together  with  the  heavy  stock  remaining  on  hand  at  the  end  of  1854,  has  been  sufficient  to  supply  the  wants  of  the  trade.  What  has  been  received  of  the  new  crop  is  of  excellent  quality,  and  from  all  we  can  learn  the  import  for  the  year  is  likely  to  be  a  full  averag3  one.  The  present  stock  is  estimated  at  1758  tons,  against  2500  tons  at  the  end  of  1854.  DIVI  Dlv.t.—lmport  2700  tons,  against  2767  tons  in  1854,  2850  tons  in  1853,  and  2000  in  1852.  The  fluctuations  in  the  value  of  this  article  have  been  unimportant,  and  with  the  exception  of  a  slight  decline  in  the  summer  months,  when  there  were  some  considerable  arrivals  of  inferior  quality,  prices  have  been  steady,  and  the  quotations  are  now  about  the  same  as  at  the  commencement  last  year.  GAMBIER.—There  has  been  a  full  average  import  during  the  past  year,  and  prices  have  gradually  declined  about  4s  per  cwt.  The  stocks  in  this  market,  as  well  as  in  London,  are  considerable,  we  believe.  FRUIT.  (Front  the  Circular  of  Messrs.  .Houghton  and  Levy.)  CURBANTS.-Our  market  during  the  past  month  has  been  exceedingly  quiet,  and  prices  of  all  descriptions  have  had  a  disposition  to  give  way.  The  duty  paid  clear clearances,  ances, clearances,  in  comparison  to  former  years,  show  a  considerable  falling  off,  being  only  ]5O  tons  against  310  tons  in  Decem December,  ber, December,  1854,  and  230  tons  in  December,  1 STYLE=superscript  853.  This,  no  doubt,  partly  arises  from  the  unsatisfactory  state  of  the  Colonial  market,  but  perhaps  is  attributable  more  directly  to  the  influence  of  high  prices.  Holders,  of  late,  have  sho  wn  a  greater  disposition  to  meet  buyers,  but  it  has  not  tended  to  increase  business,  which  for  December  has  been  more  limited  than  for  many  years.  The  arrivals  consist  of  about  450  tons  against  400  tons  in  December,  1854—the  quality  in  comparison  to  the  early  imports  is  generally  inferior,  and  is  at  present  most  difficult  of  sale.  In  com comparing  paring comparing  the  stock  with  former  years,  it  has  never  been  so  light,  and  the  dealers  generally  being  bare,  should  an  arise,  the  market  would  soon  assume  a  leman,"
