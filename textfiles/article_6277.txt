"arranged.  In  alluding  to  the  recent  occurrences  at-I  - STYLE=superscript  Tavana;,  the  President  complains  of  the  loose  Way  in  which  the  government  of  Spain  treats  the  application  of  the  American  government  for  redress  for  the  injuries  sustained  by  American  citizens.  To  avoid  the  irritating  and  vexatious  delitYs  complained  of,  a  proposition  was  made  to  provide  a  direct  appeal  for  redress  to  the  Captain  General  by  the  States  consul;  but  the  Spanish  gOverninent  has  declined  to  enter  into  such  an  arrangement;  and  on  this  point  the  President  says  This  course  on  their  part  is  deeply  re 're'  gretted  ;  for,  without  some  arrangements  of  this  kind,  the  good  understanding  between  the  two  countries  maybe  exposed  to  occasional  interrup 'interrup'  The  message  next  alludes  to  the  recent  misun  derstanding  between  the  American  and  Austrian  governments  on  the  losta  adatr  ;  and  after  a  care careful  ful careful  consideration  of  the  case,  it  appears  that  the  President  came  to  the  conclusion  that  KOSTA  was  seized  without  authority—that  be  Was  W  rong  .  fully  detained  by  the  Austrian  authorities—that  at  the  time  of  his  seizure  he  was  clothed  with  the  nationality  of  the  United  States,  and  that  therefore,  the  acts  of  the  American  officers  were  justifiable,  and  having  been  fully  approved  of,  a  compliance  with  the  several  demands  of  the.  Aus Austrian  trian Austrian  governMent  had  been  deClined.  Here  a  brief  reference  is  made  to  the  official  correspon correspondence,  dence, correspondence,  and  the  President  takes  leave  of  the  subject  with  this  significant  assurance  The  principles  and  Policy  therin  maintained  on  the  part  of  the  United  States,  will,  whenever  proper  occasion  occurs,  be  applied  and  With  respect  to  France  the  message  says:—  With  France  our  relations  continue  on  the  most  friendly  footing,  The  extensive  commerce  between  the  United  States  and  that  country,  might,  it  is  conceived,  be  released  from  some  un 'un'  necessary  restrictions.  to  the  mutual  advantage  both  parties.  With  a  view  to  this  object,  some  progress  has  been  made  in  negotiating  a  treaty  of  'commerce  and  From  this  point  the  PRESIDENT  goes  on  to  trace  the  results  of  various  matters_  connected  with  events  in  Japan,  China,  Peru,  Brazil,  and  Mexico,  and,  after  drawing  several  vast  deductions  from  the  rapid  strides  the  States  have  made  in  every  department  of  civilised  life,  he  says,  with  all  the  solemnity  of  truth  The  United  States  have  continued  gra gradually  dually gradually  and  steadily  to  expand,  through  acquisitions  of  territory,  which,  how  much  soever  some  of  them  may  have  been  questioned,  are  now  universally  seen  and  admitted  to  have  been  wise  in  policy,  just  in  character,  and  a  great  element  in  the  advance  of  our  country,  and,  with  it,  of  the  human  race,  in  prosperity,  and  in  happiness.  The  thirteen  States  have  grown  to  be  thirty  one,  with  relations  yeaching  to  Europe  on  one  side,  and  on  the  other  to  the  distant  regions  of  In  reference  to  'the  internal  condition  of  the  States,  and  the  policy  of  Government,  the  PRESI PRESIDENT  DENT PRESIDENT  is  no  less  explanatory  than  we  find  him  on  foreign  affairs.  He  traces  with  great  care  and  perspicuity  the  great  principles  which  constitute  the  organic  -basis  of  the  great  union  of  States  over  which  he  has  been  called  to  preside,  and  while  he  glories  in  the  effective  democracy  of  the  nation,  he  describes  tile  vital  essence  of  its  being  and  its  greatness.  He  demands,  as  a  primary  duty,  the  utmost  integrity  and  fidelity  on  the  part  of  those  ,  concerned  in  administering  the  high  trusts  reposed  in  them  by  the  constitution,  especially  in  the  ap application  plication application  of  the  public  funds  drawn  from  the  taxation  of  the  people,  and  appropriated  to  specific  objects.  Of  the  revenue  he  says  Ours  almost,  .  if  not  absolutely,  the  solitary  power  of  Christendom,  having  a  surplus  revenue,,  drawn  immediately  from  imports  on  commerce,  and  therefore  measured  by  the  spontaneous  en 'en'  terprise  and  national  prosperity  of  the  country,  with  such  indirect  relation  to  agriculture,  maim 'maim'  factures,  and  the  products  of  the  earth  and  sea,  so  as  to  violate  no  constitutional  doctrine,  and  yet  vigorously  promote  the  general  The  revenue  thus  alluded  to  is  levied  almost  insensibly  to  the  tax-payer,  and  goes  on  from  year  to  year  increasing  beyond  the  actual  political  interest  of  the  States,  and  even  beyond  the  prospective  wants  of  the  Government.  The  amount  of  the  National  securities  of  all  classes  was,  on  4th  of  March  in  this  year,  69,190,037  dollars.  Of  which  12,703,329  dollars  have  since  been  paid  off,  leaving  a  balance  of  only  56,486,708  dollars,  which  is  also  in  course  of  liquidation.  Having  thus  prepared  for  the  redemption  of  tide  National  Debt,  the  next  object  of  importance  is  the  Tariff,  and  the  message  states  that  the  plan  suggested  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  is  to  reduce  the  duties  on  certain  articles,  and  to  add  to  the  free  lists  many  articles  now  taxed,  and  especially  such  as  enter  in  manufactures,  and  are  not  largely,  or  at  all,  produced  iu  the  country,  is  corn  mended  to  your  candid  and  careful  The  announcement  here  made  will  not  take  the  readers  of  the  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES  by  surprise,  as  we  made  them  acquainted  with  the  intention  of  the  American  government  on  this  vital  subject  upwards  of  a  month  since,  and  in  nearly  the  precise  words  used  in  the  Message  .  On  the  subject  of  railways,  in_which  England  has  so  deep  an  interest,  the  President,  after  reviewing  the  great  commercial  and  political  interests  at  stake,  states,  that  surveys  were  designed  to  ascer ascertain  tain ascertain  the  most  practical  and  economical  route  for  a  railroad  from  the  Mississippi  to  the  Pacific  Ocean,  and  that  within  proper  limits  and  to  the  extent  of  the  interest  of  the  government  involved,  it  would  seem  both  expedient  and  proper,  if  an  economical  and  practicable  route  shall  be  found,  to  aid,  by  all  constitutional  means,  in  the  construction  of  a  road  which  will  unite,  by  speedy  transit,  the  populations  of  the  Pacific  and  Atlantic  States.  And  to  obviate  all  difficultY  that  might  arise  from  the  general  government's  interfering  with  the  administration  of  railroads  within  the  limits  of  the  several  states  to  be  traversed,  it  is  proposed  that  Government  interference  in  all  such  undertakings,  shall  be  incidental  rather  than  primary.  In  urging  the  propriety  of  Government  aid  in  promoting  these  stupendous  undertakings,  the  President  bases  his  arguments  on  the  successive  decennial  returns  of  the  census  since  the  adoption  of  the  constitution,  which  have  revealed  a  law  of  steady  progressive  development,  which,  in  general  terms,  is  taken  as  a  duplication  every  quarter  of  a  century.  Carried  forward,  from  the  point  already  reached,  for  only  a  short  period  of  time  as  appli applicable  cable applicable  to  the  existence  of  a  nation,  this  law  of  progress,  if  unchecked,  will  lead  to  almost  incredible  results.  A  large  allowance  for  a  dimi diminished  nished diminished  proportional  effect  of  emigration  would  not  very  materially  reduce  the  estimate,  while  the  increased  average  duration  of  human  life,  known  to  have  already  resulted  from  the  scientific  and  hygienic  improvements  for  the  past  fifty  years,  will  tend  to  keep  up  through  the  next  fifty,  or  perhaps  hundred,  the  same  ratio  of  growth  which  has  been  thus  revealed  in  past  progress.  In  the  addition  to  these  sources  of  progressive  greatness,  an  influx  of  large  masses  of  labouring  people  is  looked  for  from  Eastern  Asia  on  the  Pacific  side  of  the  Union,  while  it  is  believed  many  States  already  existing  around,  and  as  it  were  within,  the  Union,  yielding  to  the  natural  attraction  of  so  vast,  powerful,  and  prosperous  a  confederation  of  self-governing  Re-"
