She  was  becalmed  upwards  of  a  Wiehth  under  the  line.  The  Albatross  brings  65  passengers,  but  no  specie,  as  the  owners  would  not  undertake  to  incur  the  necessary  risk  upon  the  current  terms,  which  are  rather  unfavourable.  It  is,  however,  under understood  stood understood  that  the  passengers  have  a  large  quantity  of  gold  in  their  possession.  On  arriving  off  Holyhead  on  Sunday  night,  the  Albatross  encountered  the  full  force  of  the  gale,  which  at  the  time  was  raging  with  terrific  violence.  The  whole  of  the  Ship's  canvass,  as  well  as  the  shrouds  was  blown  away.  _  _  _  The  and  the  both  sailed  from  Melbourne  for  London,  before  the  departure  of  the  Albatross,  but  they  had  only  two  or  three  passengers  each  on  board.

There  had  been  very  large  arrivals  of  flour  from  the  United  States,  and  other  arrivals  were  daily  expected.  The  bay  was  full  of  ships,  and  labour  scarce,  con consequently  sequently consequently  lighterage  was  very  dear.

The  news  from  the  diggings  is  exceedingly  cheering.  Gold  continues  to  pour  into  Melbourne,  and  new  diggings,were  daily  being  discovered."
