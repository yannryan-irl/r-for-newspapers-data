"If  that  were  so,  he  would  grant  that  the  law  If  it  did  not  dhhinish  the  amount  of  drunkenn,  to  social  order  and  morality,  he  admitt  to  expect  nothing  from  it.  -  But  on  what  authority  w  affirmed,  in  the  first  place,  that  any  advantages  were  not  derived  from  Wilson  Patten's  act  ?  He  knew  not  if  they  could  take  a  better  :authority,  or  select:a  better  illustra illustration,  tion, illustration,  than  the  case  of  London  itself.  London  was  divided  into  seventeen  districts.  Sir  Richard  Mavne  was  the  head  commissioner  over  all,  comprising  a  population  of  2,500,000.  He  need  not,  therefore,  say,  that  whatever  could  be  proved  in  reference  to  London  would  more  or  less  be  applicable  to  all  their  large  towns.  (Hear,  hear.)  Sir  Richard  Mayne  ordered  a  return  to  be  made  in  all  the  districts  of  London,  and  what  did  they  show?  He  took  1834-55  from  the  first  month  to  June  in  each  year.  and  he  found  that  while  in  1854,  the  average  number  of  drunkards  every  Monday  morning  in  the  hands  of  the  police  were  3,224,  in  1835,  they  were  only  2,076.  (Hear,  hear,  and  cheers).  But,  it  is  said,  has  it  not.  been  proved  that  there  was  as  much  drunkenness  for  the  whole  week  as  before?  Certainly  not;  for  if  they  tcok  the  whole  week,  they  would  find  that'wb:ileinlBs4  the  numbers  were  13184,  in  1855  they  were  only  12,333.  (Cheers.)  It  was  then  said  that  the  reaction  was  on  Tuesday,  but  there  he  met  them  again  by  a  reference  to  the  report;  and  there  the  statement  was,  that  while  on  the  Tuesday  inâ–º  1354  there  were  2542,  in  1855  there  were  only  2101,  instead.of  the  terrible  reaction  which  was  so  much  relied  on  (Hear,  hear.)  He  held  in  his  hand  two  tables  respecting  their  own  town,  Liverponi"
