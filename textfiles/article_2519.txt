GENTLEMEN,  TN  an  ably-drawn  Requisition,  presented  this  day,  I  am  called  upon  to  allow  myself  to  be  NOMINATED  as  one  of  your  Representatives  in  the  Town  Council,  on  the  specific  ground  that  an  attempt  is  to  be  made  to  place  the  Electors  and  the  Elected  in  their  only  proper  position.  As  it  is  known  that  I  am  not  ambitious  of  a  seat  in  the  Council,  and  have,  therefore,  never  asked  for  one,  I  can  well  afford  the  use  of  my  name,  if  it  will  serve  you,  in  fighting  that  battle  of  principle  so  clearly  set  forth  in  your  requisi requisition  tion requisition  to  me,  and  in  the  one  intended  for  Mr.  Aikin—docu Aikin—documents  ments Aikin—documents  which,  I  hope,  will  be  extensively  read  in  all  the  Wards.  Whether  you  win  or  lose,  so  far  as  the  choice  of  a  Re Representative  presentative Representative  is  concerned,  the  result  will  be  of  no  conse consequence  quence consequence  to  me  individually,  because  as  I  do  not  offer  myself,  or  solicit  your  votes,  I  can  neither  be  by  an  op opponent,  ponent, opponent,  nor  by  the  constituency.  But,  in  any  event,  if  the  object  in  view  be  vigorously  supported,  the  men  of  Pitt-street  Ward  will  make  irresistible  progress  to towards  wards towards  establishing  the  only  true  principle  for  rendering  a  representative  body  what  it  ought  to  be  ;  while,  should  you  also  carry  your  own  Candidate,  your  triumph  will,  indeed,  be  worthy  of  the  best  struggle  that  can  be  made—not  for  any  man  breathing,  but  for  the  cause  you  have  evidently  at  heart.  Since  retiring  from  editorial  life,  I  have  declined  almost  all  public  labours  ;  but  should  your  zeal  for  a  great  principle  place  me  in  a  position  of  public  duty,  I  will  do  the  best  I  can  to  justify  your  noble  and  truly  constitutional  efforts.  I  remain,  gentlemen,  as  I  have  always  been,  your  inde independent  pendent independent  fellow-townsman  and  friend.  JOHN  SMITH,  Commerce-court,  Lord-street,  October  22,  1853.
