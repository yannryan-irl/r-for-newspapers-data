"SPAIN,  With  Spain,  peaceful  relations  are  still  maintained,  and  some  progress  has  been  made  in  securing  the  redress  of  wrongs  complained  of  by  this  government.  Spain  has  not  only  dis disavowed  avowed disavowed  and  disapproved  the  conduct  of  the  officers  who  illegally  seized  and  detained  the  steamer  Black  Warrior  at  Havana,  but  has  also  paid  the  sum  claimed  as  indemnity  for  the  Joss  thereby  inflicted  on  the  citizens  of  the  Unite.]  States.  In  consequence  of  a  destructive  hurricane,  which  visited  Cuba  in  1844,  the  supreme  authority  of  that  irltnd  issued  a  decree,  permitting  the  importation,  for  the  period  of  six  months,  of  certain  building  materials  and  provisions  free  of  duty,  but  revoked  it  when  about  half  the  period  had  elapsed,  to  the  injury  of  citizens  of  the  United  States  who  had  proceeded  to  act  on  the  faith  of  the  decree.  The  Spanish  Government  refused  indemnification  to  the  parties  aggrieved  until  recently,  when  it  was  assented  to,  payment  being  promised  to  be  made  so  soon  as  the  amount  duo  can  be  ascertained.  Satisfaction  claimed  for  the  arrest  and  search  of  the  steamer  Eldorado,  has  not  yet  been  accorded,  but  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  it  will  be,  and  that  case,  with  others,  continues  to  be  urged  on  the  attention  of  the  Spanish  Government.  Ido  not  abandon  the  hope  of  concluding  with  Spain  some  'general  arrangement,  which,  if  it  do  not  wholly  prevent  the  recurrence  of  difficulties  in  Cuba,  will  render  them  less  frequent,  and  whenever  they  shall  occur,  facilitate  their  more  speedy  settle settlement.  ment. settlement."
