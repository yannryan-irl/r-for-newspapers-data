At  the  former  place,  the  accounts  state  that  the  Sugar  crop  had  nearly  all  been  gathered  in,  and  quence  of  the  scarcity  of  shipping,  freights  ruled  high.  At:  Jamaica,  trade  was  not  active.  The  steamer  New  Grenada  had  arrived  at  Panama,  with  180,000  dollars  in  specie.  that  in  cons  Commercial  advices  from  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope  to  the  15th  November  have  come  to  hand.  These  contain  the  official  returns  of  the  exports  and  imports  of  the  colony  for  the  half  year  ending  dune  30th,  1855.  At  that_  date  the  declared  value  of  imports  amounted  to  879,788/,  and  the  exports  440,816/.,  showing  a  balance  of  trade  against  the  colony  amounting  to  438,972/,  or  nearly  50  per  cent.  This  state  of  affairs  is  nothing  new  in  the  commercial  history  of  the  Cape  colony,  for  it  has  been  gradually  increasing  during  the  last  thirty  The  deficiency  is  ma.de,up  by  the  large  years  government  expendittire,  and  that  of  Indian  and  other  strangers  visiting  the  colony.  At  the  same  time  there  is  an  accumulated  debt,  which  has  now  reached  the  sum  of  700,0001.  Com Compared  pared Compared  with  the  corresponding  half  year  of  1834,  there  is  an  increase  in  both  the  imports  and  exports  ;  the,  latter  being  respectively  622,218/.  and  315,579/,  and  the  im imports  ports imports  for  the  whole  year  1,640,1421,  which  is  likely  to  be  exceeded  this  year  proportionately  with  the  increase  in  the  first  six  months.  The  chief  exports  of  the  colony,  wool  and  .wine,  continue  to  exhibit  a  . STYLE=superscript  ,  favourable  increase,  and  the  article  of  copper  ore  recently  added  to  the  'customs  list  bids  fair  to  become  an  important  item'  in  the'  export'  trade.  The  value  of  these  during  the  half  year  was  :—wool,  297  ;  888/.  against  221,8651.  in  the  cor corresponding  responding corresponding  six  months  of  1854;  wine,  33,1691.  against-13,425/.  in  .  the  previous  year;  and  copper  ore  troth  4,120/.  - STYLE=superscript  in‘lBs4,  to  14,1791.  in  1855.  The  shipments  of  bullion  during  the  six  months  eliding  December  31.  acceraing  to  'a  statement'  prepared  - STYLE=superscript  by.  Messrs.

This  feature  would  be  fully  explained  upon  the  presumption  that  the  Bank  is  assisting  the  Treasury  to  meet  the  heavy  disbursement  incidental  to  the  season.  It  will  be  noticed  that  the  sum  standing  at  the  credit  of  government  shOws  an  increase  - STYLE=superscript  of  almost  the  identical  amount.  The  English  Stock  Market  to  day  exhibited  renewed  heaviness.  At  one  period  a  fresh  decline  of  1  per  cent.  was  established,  but  at  the  close  the  reduction  from  yesterday's  final  quotations  did  not  exceed  *per  cent.  The  closing  prices  were  87  87i.  Any  tendency  'towards  improvement  is  checked.  by  the  continued  sales,  some  of  which  are  attributed  to  the  requirements  of  Governthent.  The  prospects  of  the  Money  Market  are  also  regarded  with  less  confidence.  Pending  the  Czar's  definitive  .reply,  some.  dispoSition  is  still  .  shown  to  support  the  market.  The  .general  demand  for  money  to  day  was  again  extraordinarily  active,  this  being  the  4th  of  .  the  month.  In  the  Stock  Exchange,  however,  money  was  :rather  easier,  at  about  5  per  cetit:  on  Government  Securities.  At  Paris,  to  day,  the  Three  per  Cent.  Rentes  rallied  about  per  cent.  for  money.  The  final  quotations  for  the  account  was  slightly  lower  than  that  of  yesterday.  There  was  still  some  enquiry'to-day  for  gold  for  exportatiOn.  The  improvement  to-day  in  the  Exchange  on  Paris  is  attributed  to  the  large  ,amount  of  Australian  and  other  gold  lately  remitted  from  this  side.  The  heavy  arrivals  of  silver  by  the  Tyne  may,have  had  some  influence.
