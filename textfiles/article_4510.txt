JAMAICA  By  way  of  New  York  we  have  received  advices  from  Kingston,  Jamaica,  to  the  28th  ult.,  two  days  later  than  the  advices  received  direct  by  the  West  India  mail.  The  board  of  council  had  ordered  a  return  of  all  duties  collected  by  the  customs  depart department  ment department  between  the  30th  of  April  and  the  10th  of  October  in  the  present  year,  which  return  was  also  to  show  what  would  have  been  collected  if  the  im import  port import  duties  had  been  continued  in  force.

The  first  thing  to  be  done  is  to  save  the  further  loss  of  revenue.  With  this  object  the  finance  committee  yesterday  introduced  into  the  house  the  Import  Duties  Act,  which  was  read  a  first  time,  and  stands  for  a  second  reading,  and,  probably,  for  committal  this"
