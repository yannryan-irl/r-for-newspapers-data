The  most  .widely-circulated  3-day  journal  in  Ireland  i  THE  NORTHERN  WHlG,Published  in  Belfast.  The  latest  Government  stamp  returns  show  that  The  Northein  maintains  a  high  pre-eminence  over  the  entire  provincial  press  of  Ireland,  and  that  only  one  metropolitan  3-day  journal  equals  it  in  circulation.  As  an  Advertising  medium  it  consequently  offers  advantages  which  few  Irish  journals  can  afford.  The  repeal  of  the  Advertisement  duty  has  caused  the  adoption  of  a  new  and  very  much  reduced  scale  of  charges  —  viz  :-  -Under  10  lines  (or  75  words)  2s.  Od.
