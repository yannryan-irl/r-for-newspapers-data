"TO  THE  EDITOR  OF  THE  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES  Sin—ln  reply  to  a  letter  from  Mr.  David  M'Clellan,  which  appeared  in  the  ilfercury  of  this  day  (Tuesday),  I,  as  the  person  who  report  ed  the  case  of  Wilcock  v.  Shrivall  for  the  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES,  have  to  state,  in  the  first  place,  that  the  report  in  question  is  substantially  correct,  and  gives  the  facts  of  the  case  as  they  transpired  in  evidence  accurately,  and  with  truth.  One  error  I  certainly  fell  into:  I  mentioned  that  the  mother  of  Mr.  M'Clellan  was  ex examined  amined examined  as  to  the  character  of  the  young  girl,  who  was  plain plaintiff  tiff plaintiff  in  the  case,  when  the  lady  who  gave  this  evidence  was  a  Mrs.  .Windron,  a  friend  of  Mrs.  M'Clellan.  It  must,  however,  be  quite  evident  that  this  inaccuracy  in  no  way  changes  a  single  salient  feature  of  the  case,  nor  does  it  alter  it  in  any  way  to  bear  favourably  or  unfavourably  on  any  of  the  parties  concerned.  As  to  the  insinuation  of  the  reporter  acting  in  collusion.  with  Mr.  Shrivall,  or  any  agent  of  his,  I  indignantly  repu repudiate  diate repudiate  the  charge;  and  I  think  it  was  base  to  make  it  without  considering  better  whether  it  was  likely  to  have  foundation.  The  only  conversation  I  had  with  Mr.  Shrivall  was  this  :  When  I  was  leaving  the  Court,  he  asked  me  not  to  give  the  report  of  the  case  ;  I  replied  that  I  had  no  discretion  in  the  matter  ;  that  if  he  pleased  he  might  call  on  Mr.  Charles  Willmer,  19,  South  John-street,  who  was  the  person  with  whom  such  discretion  lay.  In  conclusion,  I  willingly  leave  it  to  the  public  to  judge  whether  my  report,  short  though  it  be,  is  not  a  fair,  impar impartial,  tial, impartial,  and  (with  the  exception  of  a  merely  accidental  inaccu inaccuracy  racy inaccuracy  as  to  a  name)  truthful  outline  of  the  case  as  it  came  out  before  the  court  on  Saturday.

LIVERPOOL  DISTRICT  COURT  (IF  BANKRUPTCY.  (BEFORE  MR.  COMMISSIONER  PERRY.)  In  re  Peverelle.  A  CASE  or  FRAUD.—In  this  case,  Louis  Peverille,  one  of  the  creditors  on  the  estate,  was  summoned  as  a  witness.  Mr.  PEMBERTON,  the  solicitor  to  the  bankrupt,  said,  that  from  information  afforded  to  him  that  morning  by  the  witness,  Mr.  Louis  Peverelle,  he  had  sent  for  Mr.  Yates  to  his  office,  to  hear  what  he  said  with  regard  to  this  debt,  and  also  with  regard  to  his  books.  Mr.  Peverelle  had  not  brought  his  books,  and  the  reason  he  gave  why  he  did  not  do  so  in  obedience  to  the  summons,  was  that  a  communication  was  made  to  him  by  a  M  r  .  John  Poncia,  who  was  also  a  creditor,  who  stated  that  the  witness  would  have  to  prove  in  a  proper  way,  and  he  had  not  brought  his  books,  because  he  thought  no  power  could  compel  him  to  do  so.  He  (Mr.  Pemberton)  told  him  he  would  have  to  produce  his  books.  The  total  amount  of  Mr.  Peverelle's  claim  was  £412,  and  he  purported  to  give  credit  for  £ll,  which  reduced  the  debt  to  £4Ol.  He  (Mr.  Pemberton)  told  the  witness  that  he  would  have  to  show  by  whom  the  goods  were  sent,  the  time  of  delivery,  and  as  a  matter  of  course  the  delivery  receipts.  From  questions  put  to  Mr.  Peverelle  in  the  presence  of  Mr.  Yates,  he  must  say  this  debt  was  not  anything  like  the  amount  put  down  on  the  face  of  the  balance  sheet,  and  which  had  been  attempted  to  be  set  up  by  Louis  Peverelle.  He  (Mr.  Pemberton)  had  told  him  to  answer  every  question  put  to  him,  to  have  regard  for  no  one  but  himself  in  this  transaction,  and  that  if  he  had  been  induced  to  make  out  this  account  to  £4Ol,  at  the  request  of  any  one,  he  must  tell  who  the  party  was,  and  tell  his  localit  y  .  His  HONOR  :  What  is  to  become  of  your  client  ?  Mr.  PEMBERTON  did  not  think  he  should  appear  for  him  any  further,  and  certainly  would  not  have  done  so  so  far,  but  that  'he  was  of  opinion  the  bankrupt  would  not  be  guilty  of  being  accessary  to  placing  such  a  debt  on  the  file.  It  would  be  remembered  that  the  bankrupt  stated  to  him.  (Mr.Pemberton)  the  penalty  he  wouldincur  by  such  a  proceed proceeding.  ing. proceeding.  Why  he  had  done  so,  he  knew  not.  He  must  answer  for  himself.  When  he  was  before  your  Honor,  he  (Mr.  Pemberton)  had  told  the  witness  who  was  now  about  to  be  examined,  to  answer  every  question,  regardless  of  everybody  but  himself  in  the  transaction,  and  to  state  everything.  Mr.  YATES  :The  witness  is  ready  to  confess  the  fraud.  Mr.  Lewis  Peverelle  was  then  examined  at  considerable  length  by  Mr.  Yates,  touching  certain  fabricated  invoices  of  roods,  purporting  .  to  have  been  supplied  to  the  bankrupt.  It  appeared  that  on  the  7th  October  last,  the  witness  was  applied  to  by  the  official  assignee,  Mr.  Cazenove,  for  a  statement  of  his  claim  against  the  estate.  He  accordingly  sent  in  nine  invoices,  or  accounts  of  goods,  purporting  to  have  been  delivered  to  the  bankrupt,  the  gross  amount  being  set  forth  as  £412  I  ls.  21,  - STYLE=superscript  -d.  •  but  he  now  admitted  that  these  accounts  were  manufactured  for  the  pur purpose  pose purpose  of  increasing  his  claim  against  the  estates,  and  that  the  real  debt  due  to  him  was  somewhere  about  £lO.  He  said  that  he  fabricated  those  invoices  at  the  request  of  the  bankrupt,  and  that  he  brought  the  amount  up  to  the  desired  sum  of  £4OO,  by  in increasing  creasing increasing  the  price  and  the  original  items,  and  adding  others  which  were  fictitious.  He  altered  his  day  book,  but  not  the  ledger,  to  correspond  with  this  fabricated  amount,  and  he  observed  that  if  his  books  were  produced,  they  would  prove  the  fraud  which  he  now  admitted.  Mr.  YATES,  during  the  course  of  the  examination,  showed  how  the  fraud  had  been  committed,  and  how  the  newly  fur furnished  nished furnished  accounts  were  easily  detected  to  be  fabrications.  Among  the  papers  delivered  to  the  court  was  the  original  invoice  of  the  bona  fide  goods  furnished  to  the  bankrupt  by  the  witness,  who  is  his  uncle.  This  invoice  was  partially  burnt,  but  sufficient  remained  to  shew  how  the  prices  and  items  in  the  new  invoices  were  filled  up,  and'  the  fictitious  ones  added  in.  The  COMMISSIONER  , STYLE=superscript  said  that  he  regretted  very  much  to  have  heard  the  examination,  and  he  thought  that  the  witness  himself  must  have  regretted  it,  if  he  bad  any  proper  feelings.  The  witness  replied  that  he  deeply  regretted  his  conduct.  The  ComussioNEn.  proceeded  to  say  that  what  the  conse consequences  quences consequences  might  be  to  the  witness,  and  the  other  parties,  remained  to  be  seen.  It  was  then  agreed,  after  some  discussion  between  yr.  Yates  and  Mr.  Pemberton,  that  the  warrant  for  neglecting  compliance  with  the  summons  of  the  court  should  not  issue  against  the  witness  if  he  undertook  to  produce,  on  Thursday,  his  books,  and  the  letter  of  the  bankrupt  requesting  him  to  make  out  the  fabricated  invoices.  The  case  was  accordingly  adjourned  to  half-past  one  o'clock  on  Thursday.  SHREIVSBURY  AUTUMN  RACES.  These  races  commenced  yesterday  under  very  favourable  auspices.
