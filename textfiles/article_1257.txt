"chief  necessaries  of  of  an  active  labour  Without  these  two  essentials  it  be-  comes  very  questionable  whether  the  excise  duties  could  be  retained  as  a  source  of  income.  The  crown  lands  also  seem  to  have  been  arranged  on  a  better  system;  as  it  is  rather  a  rare  circum circumstance  stance circumstance  to  find  a  surplus  over  expenditure  in  this  department.  The  subjoined  figures  show  the  income  and  charge  of  the  Consolidated  Fund.  In  the  income  we  are  glad  to  find  a  further  increase,  while  we  lament  to  learn  that  the  charge  is  so  great  as  to  leave  but  a  small  surplus  in  the  income  :  Quarters  ended  10th  Oct.,  INCOME.  1852  1853.  £  £  Customs  5,056,866  5,178,271  Excise  4,313,591  4,319,259  Stamps  1,529,421  1,628,163  Taxes  -  159,215  129,219  Property  Tax  1,915,581  1,940,048  Post  Office  -  261,000  236,000  Crown  Lands  50,000  Miscellaneous  -  17  ,  799  40,199  Imprest  and  other  Moneys  -  51,425  36,517  Produce  of  the  Sale  of  Old  Stores  •  86,571  85,239  Repayments  of  Advances  -  234,042  441,254  14,084,169  To  Cash  brought  to  this  Account  to  pay  off  Deficiency  Bills  600,000  13,665,511  14,684,169  Quarters  ended  10th  Oct.,  CHARGE.  1852.  1853.  £  £  Permanent  Debt  -  -  5,424,557  5,406,821  Terminable  Annuities  -  1,303,492  1,302,595  Sinking  Fund  -  436,360  892,156  The  Civil  List  -  -  99,382  99,540  Other  Charges  on  the  Consolidated  Fund  -  -  378,246  428,167  For  advances  -  -  388,835  814,947  Interest  on  Exchequer  Bills,  issued  to  meet  the  charge  on  the  Consoli Consolidated  dated Consolidated  Fund  71  770  Total  charge  8,030,943  8,944,996  The  surplus  -  6,634,568  5,739,173  13,665,511  14,684,169  The  amount  of  Exchequer  Bills  issued  to  meet  the  charge  on  the  consoli consolidated  dated consolidated  fund  in  the  quarter  ending  sth  July  1853,  and  paid  off  out  of  the  growing  produce  thereof,  after  deducting  £610,000  cancelled  by  sinking  fund  -  -  .  •  2,595,557  The  amount  issued  in  the  quarter  ended  10th  October,  1853,  in  part  of  the  sums  granted  by  Parliament  out  of  the  consolidated  fund  for  supply  services  -  5,367,799  ...

Such  a  large  amount  of  paper  being  thrown  upon  the  money  market  at  this  critical  moment,  and  at  the  advanced  rate  of  interest  offered  by  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  must  lead  to  a  great  absorption  of  the  money  re required  quired required  for  trade  and  commercial  purposes.  The  necessity  which  compelled  the  present  Chan Chancellor  cellor Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  to  resort  to  so  large  an  issue  of  Exchequer  Bills,  must  be  urgent  indeed,  and  looks  as  if  the  Eastern  Question  has  already  cost  a  something  more  than  mere  talk.  We  have  still,  however,  great  faith  in  the  increased  import  of  bullion,  which  must  soon  be  coming  forward  in  large  quantities.  The  amount  withdrawn  by  the  Government  to  meet,  its  immediate  wants,  will  be  speedily  replaced  by  fresh  arrivals  of  the  precious  metals.  The  advanced  price  of  .  all  the  commodi commodities  ties commodities  required  for  the  Government  service  must  have  led  to  a  great  increase  in  the  expenditure  above  the  amount  specified  in  the  estimates  of  the  public  in income  come income  for  the  present  year.  Any  inconvenience  that  may  arise  from  . STYLE=superscript  !  this  source,  cannot  be  attri attributed  buted attributed  to  any  direct  want  of  sagacity  or  foresight  on  the  part  of  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer.  It  has  arisen  from  a  variety  of  circumstances,  which,  though  early  foreseen,  could  not  be  avoided  or  over-ruled  ;  and  we  only  fear  that  in  the  next  return  we  shall  find  the  difficulty  experienced  at  the  present  moment  increased  three-fold.  The  difficulty  arising  from  this  source  will  be  purely  fiscal,  and  will  not  be  felt  to  any  serious  extent  by  the  trading  and  commercial  interests.  It  is  a  fact  worthy  of  remark,  at  this  moment,  that  the  only  powers  in  the  world,  which  have  a  surplus  in  their  coffers,  and  which  possess  un unlimited  limited unlimited  credit,  are  Great  Britain  and  the  United  States.  This  fact  ought  to  strike  the  attention  of  all  the  continental  powers  of  Europe.  THE  CHANCELLOR  OF  THE  EXCHEQUER.—This  Right  Hon.  Gentleman  arrived'  in  Manchester,  on  Monday  afternoon.
