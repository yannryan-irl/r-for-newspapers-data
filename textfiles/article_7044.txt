"MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL.  •  LIVERPOOL,  WEDNESDAY  EVENING.  The  position  of  affairs  in  political  circles  con continues  tinues continues  to  produce  feelings  of  depression  in  the  London  Stock  Market,  and  everything  to  show  a  growing  want  of  confidence  in  Lord  Aber Aberdeen's  deen's Aberdeen's  premiership.  Recent  events  have  helped  much  towards  infusing  increasing  doubt  into  the  public  mind  as  to  the  stability  of  a  cabinet  corn  posed  of  such  conflicting  prejudices,  all  of  which  are  at  this  moment  on  their  trail.  On  foreign  affairs  we  have  the  very  antipodes  of  political  predilec predilections  tions predilections  ;  while,  on  the  subject  of  parliamentary  reform,  the  .  extremes  of  party  compose  the  ministry,  who  have  to  agree  among  themselves  before  the  public  are  to  be  admitted  to  its  diacuseion.  The  possibility  of  a  thorough  and  positive  understanding  being  come  to  between  all  parties  in  the  cabinet  on  these  subjects  is  held  to  be  purely  problematical:  and  whilst  these  impres impressions  sions impressions  were  gaining  ground,  greater  anxiety  is  begin  ning  to  manifest  itself  as  to  the  exact  position  of  affairs  in  the  East.  Acted  upon  by  such  influences  the  funds  must  continue  to  -  decline  in  value  ;  whereas  if  it  were  not  for  the  existence  of  these  two  serious  disturbing  causes,  the  general  condition  of  the  country  would  justify  a  range  of  prices  for  our  public  securities  which  has  never  before  been  attained.  Consols  opened  at  934  buyers,  being  per  cent  lower  than  the  closing  price  of  yesterday,  but  towards  the  afternoon  they  advanced  4  per  cent.,  from  which  they  again  receded,  and  finally  closed  at  934,  being  a  decline  of  fi  per  cent  since  yesterday.  Three  and  a  quarter  per  cents  95%  to  954.  Bank  Stock,  219  to  225.  Exchequer  Bills,  3s.  to  6s.  preni.  The  Railway  Share  Market  was  languid  to-day,  'and  a  further  decline  of  prices  took  place.  Great  Northern,  84  to  85.  Ditto  A,  83%  to  84%.  Lanca Lancashire  shire Lancashire  and  Yorkshire,  67  to  674.  Ditto  Fifths,  6%  to  61.  South  Western,  103%  to  104%.  North  British,  30%  to  312.  North  Staffordshire,  5e  to  5%.  York  and  Berwick,  634  to  64.  Manchester,  Sheffield,  taid  Lincoln,  22%  to  231  Eastern  Counties,  134  to  13%.  Caledonians,  54%  to  551.  Ditto  Preference,  99  to  101.  In  the  Miscellaneous  Share  Market  there  was  scarcely  any  alteration.  In  the  Foreign  House  we  notice  a  decline  in  Mexican  and  Buenos  Ayres  Stocks,  but  the  amount  of  business  done  was  trifling.  Mexicans,  231  to  24.  Spanish  New  Deferred,  461-  to  461.  Ditto  Three  per  Cents,  21k  to  21i.  Ditto  Passive,  to  5.  The  present  state  of  the  weather,  the  season  of  the  year,  and  the  large  speculative  operations  going  on  in  the  French  Corn  Market  have  led  to  an  advance  of  2s.  per  quarter  on  the  price  of  English  *wheat  in  the  London  market.  The  short  supplies  of  Eng English  lish English  grain,  which  we  have  noticed  for  some  weeks,  have  also  helped  to  advance  prices,  but  as  this  weather  will  induce  farmers  to  prepare  their  grain  for  market,  a  larger  quantity  may  be  expected  be  fore  long,  and  when  French  speculators  find  them themselves  selves themselves  overtaken  by  the  reaction  which  must  inevi inevitably  tably inevitably  follow  the  arrivals  of  the  vast  fleet  of  corn cornladen  laden cornladen  vessels  now  at  sea;  our  markets  will  become  more  steady,  and  less  in  favour  of  holders.  The  business  inifavour  of  Foreign  wheat  was  extensive,  and  at  the  extreme  rates  of  Friday  last.  Barley  was  quoted  ls..  to  2s.  per  quarter  dearer.  The  following  are  the  latest  returns  of  the  arri arrivals  vals arrivals  :—British—Wheat,  570  qrs.  ;  barley,  1,060  qrs.  ;  oats,  680  qrs.  ;  malt,  400  qrs.  ;  flour,  480  sacks.  Foreign—Wheat,  1,890  qrs.  ;  barley,  1,140  qrs.  ;  oats,  5,030  qrs.;  flour,  6,290  barrels.  It  was  stated  on  'Change_  again  to-day,  that  the  British  merchants  at  St.  Petersburg  were  gradually  bringing  their  affairs  within  a  narrow  compass,  in  order  to  be  prepared  to  leave  at  a  short  notice.  And  several  who  had  entered  into  contracts  for  hemp,  tallow,  and  other  products,  had  disposed  of  them  at  a  pecuniary  loss  to  Russian  firms.  These  and  other  rumours  of  dreary  character  had  produced  a  further  decline  in  the  value  of  Consols  which  were  done  after  the  official  closing  at  931  to  93.1.  The  report  that  the  King  of  Sweden  intended  to  join  the  Emperor  of  Russia  was  contradicted  by  the  Swedish  merchants.  On  the  London  'Change,  Scotch  Pig  Iron  was  quoted  at  795.  6d.,  and  several  long  transactions  on•Spelter  at  241.  per  ton  on  the  spot  to  251.  per  ton  for  spring  delivery  are  reported.  Saltpetre  in  demand  at  30s.  to  325.  Tallow,  58s.  9d.  to  595.  on  the  spot,  and  695.  forward  delivery.  The  Liverpool  Cotton  Market  was  remarkably  firm  to-day  with  a  good  inquiry.  The  sales  amounted  to  6,000  bales  of  which  10  were  taken  speculation  and  for  export.  Our  Shire  Market  was  much  depressed,  and  the  business  done  was  at  a  further  decline,  Caledo Caledonians,  nians, Caledonians,  27*,  I;  Eastern  Counties,  131,  , STYLE=superscript  7  3  ;  Lancashire,  and  Yorkshire,  66/,  8;  London  and  North  Western,  1038,  4;  Midland,  621,1;  South  Eastern,  188,  I;  York  and  North,  238,  i;  Sheffield  Stock,  23,  k.
