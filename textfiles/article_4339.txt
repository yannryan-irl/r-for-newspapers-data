"CRAYON  SKETCHES.  BY  THE  COUNT  DE  GABALIS.  Drawn  expressly  for  Northern  Daily  Tinies.'i  NO.  II  THE  PARIS  CORRESPONDENT  OF  THE  TIMES  Civis,  gum  tibi  creditum  Debes  Virgilium,  finibus  Atticis  Reddas  mcolumem,  precor,  Et  serves  animas  dimidium  mem  TURN  your  eyes  to  the  west,—that  magnificent  sheet  of  water,  as  broad  as  if  illimitable;  now  calm  as  if  a  lake,  between  those  long,  ridgy  strips  of  land—call  them  promontories  or  peninsulas,  or  what  you  please—with  the  low-lying  isles  upon  its  bosom—that's  Bantry  Bay.  It  may  derive  some  degree  of  interest  with  many  to  bear  in  mind  that  here  it  was,  half  a  century  since,  the  French  fleet  was  scattered  by  the  elements  as  a  preliminary  to  the  ruin  of  '9B  ;  but  this  appeal  to  the  memory  should  be  either  political  or  partial,  and  at  present  we  want  neither;  while  the  painter,  the  poet,  or  the  tourist,  can  contemplate  the  majesty  of  nature  in  its  wide  and  beautiful  expanse,  and  feel  that  so  long  as  the  boundless  Atlantic  rolls  its  billows,  and  that  Alpine  chain  elevates  its  crests—so  long  as  the  wild  and  grand  and  picturesque  are  attractive  to  the  heart  and  eye—Bantry  Bay  will  not  want  for  a  host  of  admirers.  It  has,  however,  another  charm  and  a  sweeter  spell  to  awaken  our  attention.  In  that  dark  and  dingy-looking  town  —now,  at  all  events,  cheerless,  whilst  in  deep  shadow—was  born  the  subject  of  our  present  sketch,  the  Paris  Corres Correspondent  pondent Correspondent  of  the  Times!"
