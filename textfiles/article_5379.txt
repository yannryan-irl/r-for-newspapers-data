GREAT  MEETING  OF  OPERATIVES.  FROM  OUR  OWN  CORRESPONDENT.)  PRESTON,  SATURDAY  EVENING.  —There  was  an  immense  gathering  of  the  factory  operatives  of  this  town  in  the  Orchard,  at  three  o'clock  this  afternoon  ;  it  being  under understood  stood understood  that  their  favourite  chieftain,  Mr.  George  Cowell,  would  deliver  an  address.  Mr.  Rhodes,  of  Stockport,  was  installed  in  the  office  of  chairman.  Most  of  the  delegates  were  in  attendance,  but  few  of  them  had  an  opportunity  of  speaking,  in  consequence  of  the  unlimited  time  available  for  the  proceedings:  The  meeting  was  very  spirited  and  en enthusiastic,  thusiastic, enthusiastic,  and  evinced  a  strong  determination  not  to  accept  the  terms  proposed  by  the  Masters'  Association,  in  their  resolutions  of  the  Ist  instant.  The  CHAIRMAN  said  the  millocracy  of  Preston  were  now  resorting  to  their  last  expedient,  and  if  the  operatives  would  only  be  :firm  and  determined,  and  above  all  things  keep  the  peace,  victory  was  certain,  and  that  ere  long.  (Cheers.)  Let  them  be  of  good  cheer,  despite  the  resolutions  issued  by  the  Masters'  Association  on  Thursday  last.  They  thought  that  as  Christmas  was  coming  on,  the  mills  in  some  of  the  manufacturing  districts  would  cease  labour  for  two  days,  and  in  some  instances  for  a  week,  and  that  as  a  result  there  would  be  a  small  subscription  coming  into  Preston,  which  would  have  the  effect  of  starving  the  operatives  into  sub submission.  mission. submission.  He,  however,  begged  to  state  that  the  people  of  those  districts  were  retaining  sufficient  funds  in  hand.to  en enable  able enable  them  to  send  a  larger  sum  than  ever  in  Christmas  week.  (Cheers.)  Mr.  WADDINGTON  having  briefly  addressed  the  assembly,  assuring  them  that  they  had  a  glorious  prospect  in  view.  Mr.  COWELL  was  introduced  amid  general  acclamations.  He  observed  that  after  a  struggle  of  eight  weeks,  they  had  gained  one  victory.  The  primary  object  of  the  masters  in  closing  their  mills  was  to  crush  the  operatives'  union.  Now  (said  he),  when  they  have  thrown  us  in  the  streets,  and  find  that  they  cannot  crush  our  union,  what  do  they  say  ?  They  will  let  us  go  back  to  our  work,  and  we  must  not  have  our  union  !  (Shouts  of  derision.)  The  speaker  - STYLE=superscript  proceeded  to  criticise  a  placard  headed  mills  and  ad addressed  dressed addressed  the  factory  operatives  of  which  had  not  then  appeared  upon  the  walls,  but  which  was  issued  in  the  course  of  the  evening,  and.  created  considerable  excite excitement  ment excitement  amongst  the  unemployed.  This  placard  (said  Mr.  Cowell)  admits  that  we  have  gained  the  victory.  Our  mas masters  ters masters  declared  emphatically  tat  they  were  determined  to  crush  combination  amongst  the  working  classes.  But  now  that  we  are  locked  out,  and  find  that  we  are  gaining  sym sympathy  pathy sympathy  on  every  hand;  when  we  find  the  people  in  the  rural  districts,  and  not  only  there,  but  in  such  towns  as  Liverpool,  and  Glasgow,  and  London,  not  promising  us  support,  but  sending  its  plenty  of  money,  I  say,  when  we  ha  ve  these  things  before  our  eyes,  it  is  evident  that  the  victory  is  almost  gained,  and  that  the  manufacturers  are  going  on  their  last  crutches.  Those  crutches  will  soon  break,  and  then  you  will  be  freed  from  your  fetters,  and  be  enabled  to  sing  with  truth  Britons  never  shall  be  (Cheers.)  The  placard  thus  The  Preston  lock-out  is  at  an  I  wonder  who  told  the  writer  so.  The  Preston  lock lockout  out lockout  is  not  at  an  end.  Why  were  you  locked  out  ?  In  the  first  place,  because  they  wished  to  destroy  combination  amongst  the  working  classes  ;  and  'secondly,  because  they  desired  to  deprive  you  of  the  10  per  cent.  which  they  had  just  yielded.  Now,  when  they  find  they  cannot  starve  you  into  submission  '  they  will  forego  the  abolition  of  the  union,  but  they  will  take  from  you  the  10  per  cent.,  and  you  may  depend  upon  it  the  battle  is  ours.  (Cheers.)  You  may,  if  you  please,  return  to  work  ;  you  may,  if  you  please,  again  earn  your  daily  bread,  and  be  no  longer  dependant  upon  the  charity  of  others  ;  and  you  may  do  all  this  without  being  humbled,  without  any  compromise  of  your  feelings,  your  principles,  or  your  But  the  Blackburn  masters  can  find  a  vent  for  their  goods  ;  and  I  will  tell  you  how  I  know  this,  if  a  weaver  can't  turn  off  enough  work  in  Blackburn,  he  must  put  on  his  coat  and  go  about  his  business.  Now  I  ask,  is  it  reasonable  to  sup suppose  pose suppose  if  the  masters  did  not  buy  the  cloth  they  would  people  because  they  could  not  get  a  sufficient  quantity  off  their  looms  ?  (Hear,  hear.)  The  press  wants  us  to  sur surrender  render surrender  and  give  the  masters  the  victory.  We  say,  in  reply,  give  us  the  ten  per  cent.  and  our  union,  or  if  you  don't  like  that,  pay  us  according  to  the  Blackburn  standard  list  of  prices;  we'll  have  either  one  or  the  other,  and  then  we'll  go  in.  You  may  depend  upon  it  we  are  determined  to  have  as  much  for  our  labour  in  Preston  as  they  have  in  other  places.  (Cheers.)  The  battle  between  capital  and  says  the  placard,  been  fairly  fought  so  far  in  Preston.  The  masters  have  put  forth  their  strength,  and  the  latent  energies  of  the  working  classes  have  also  been  displayed;  proving  most  clearly  that  such  a  conflict  is  most  unnatural  and  equally  ruinous  to  both  sides.  Circumstances  have,  however,  arisen  which  give  the  masters  an  immense  ad advantage  vantage advantage  in  the  conflict.  They  are  nevertheless  willing,  upon  two  indispensable  conditions,  to  abandon  the  conflict,  and  it  will  be  nothing  less  than  self-ruining  madness  if  you  decline  the  peace  or  truce  they  offer.  Upon  former  occasions,  harder  terms  have  been  successfully  im imposed  posed imposed  upon  you,  and  it  has  even  now  been  said  that  the  masters  woad  not  re-open  their  mills  until  the  workmens'  committees  were  broken  up  and  their  unions  dissolved.  They  know  they  can't  do  that,  said  Mr.  Cowell.  The  remainder  of  the  placard  was  as  follows  But  observe  well,  no  condition  is  required;  the  hours  are  left  untouched,  you  may  resume  work  and  maintain  your  unions,  and  can  you  reasonably  require  more  ?  True,  it  may  be  that  neither  party  can  claim  a  victory—true  it  may  be  that  the  artizans  lose  the  ten  per  cent—but  you  preserve  your  unions  ;  and  surely,  far-seeing  people  must  perceive  that  this  is  incomparably  the  most  important  point  for  you.  Hitherto,  the  operations  of  the  unions  have  been,  beyond  expectation,  successful  ;  under  a  compulsory  the  sympathies  of  the  public  have  been  expected  in  your  favour  ;  hut  the  masters  have  now,  upon  very  reasonable  and  only  necessary  conditions,  proposed  to  re-open  the  mills.  The  public  will  condemn  you  for  refusing  those  conditions;  you  will  lose  the  public  sympathy;  short  time  will  lessen  the  wages  of  your  warmest  friends  ;  your  collections  will  in  consequence  diminish  ;  and  then  on  your  side  defeat  commences.  Now,  in  the  full  tide  of  your  prosperity,  honourable  terms  are  proposed  to  you  ;  and  surely,  common  sense  says,  accept  them  !  Ask  yourselves  calmly,  is  there  any  prospect  of  better  terms  ?  - STYLE=superscript  With  the  civil  war  in  China,  and  with  war  in  Europe  ;  with  scarcity  and  high  prices  in  France  and  England  ;  what  prospect  is  there  of  any  improvement  in  the  cotton  trade,  either  home  or  foreign,  during  the  coming  year  ?  It  has  been  said  that  the  Preston  masters  were  only  bound  together  for  three  months  ;  and  it  has  been  hoped,  that  after  Christmas,  some  mills  would  be  re-opened,  but  this  is  a  false  impression.  It  is  now  known  that  the  associ associated  ated associated  masters  are  bound  together  for  twelve  months,  so  that,  with  the  bad  prospect  of  trade,  and  under  the  power  of  the  masters'  bond,  there  is  no  probability  whatever  that  better  terms  can  be  offered  to  the  artizans  of  Preston  for  the  next  nine  months,  than  those  now  proposed  to  you.  Then,  be  wise  ;  return  to  your  work  ;  put  an  end  to  the  misery,  want,  and  ruin  which  is  now  overwhelming  to  many  families  in  Preston.
