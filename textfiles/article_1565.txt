Tea  —There  is  a  good  demand  for  nearly  all  kinds  of  Congou  at  rather  improved  prices,  but  holders  are  not  free  sellers,  wait waiting  ing waiting  the  delivery  of  the  Overland  Letters  to-morrow.  Some  of  the  new  crop  Congous  have  arrived  in  London;  a  few  of  the  finest  have  sold  at  2s  6d  per  lb.  ;  they  are  deficient  in  strength  and  make  of  leaf  as  compared  with  last  season.  Nothing  reported  in  Indigo  or  Lac  Dye  ;  170  chests  of  Shell  Lac  have  been  disposed  of  at  32s  6d  to  50s,  as  in  quality,  about  60  bales  Turkey  Gum  Arabic  at  51s  6d  per  cwt.,  16  casts  Java  Cochineal  at  4s.  per  lb.,  50  bales  heated  Cutch  at  555,  250  bags  Sago  Flour  at  21s  6d  to  235,  250  bags  Pearl  Sago  at  19s  to  20s,  1200  bags  Myrabolams  at  Os  6d  to  13s  6d  per  cwt.,  and  n  few  cases  Cantor  Oil  at  3•1,1  to  4d  per  lb.  A  apaeulativa  demand  has  appeared  for  Saltpetre,  and  about  1500  bags  sold  at  27s  6d  to  30s  3d  for  9  to  11  per  cent.  refraction,  being  an  advance  of  is  to  is  6d  per  cwt.  Nitrate  of  Soda  continues  steady,  and  600  bags  sold  at  17s  6d  per  cwt.  In  Dyewoods  only  a  moderate  business  has  been  done,  'the  transactions  consisting  of  100  tons  Jamaica  and  St.  Domingo  Logwood  at  £5  to  £.5  2s  6d,  35  tons  Ceara  Fustic  at  £6  12s  6d  to  £7  2s  6d,  25  tons  Lima  Wood  at  £l3  10s  to  £l4.  and  10  tons  Sapan  Wood  at  £l5  per  ton.  No  sales  in  Turpentine,  but  of  Tar  500  barrels  Stockholm  have  been  sold  at  20s  fid  per  barrel.  American  Resin  still  in  good  demand  ;  2500  barrels  sold  at  6s  3d  to  7s  for  common,  to  12s  6d  per  cwt.  for  fine.  Ashes  have  continued  in  good  request,  and  1000  barrels  sold  at,  30s  for  Pot,  and  28s  per  cwt.  for  Pearl.  500  bags  Bombay  Linseed  sold  at  54s  6d  per  quarter,  and  sales  have  been  made  in  American  Cloverseed  at  49s  to  50s,  and  German  at  •47,  per  cwt.  The  market  for  Hides  continues  dull  ;  1640  dry  salted  Brazil  have  been  sold  at  sid,  and  2500  wet  salted  at  4d  to  4P  per  lb.,  which  are  rather  lower  rates.  The  demand  for  Brimstone  has  been  limited,  only  small  lots  having  been  taken,  at  previous  prices.  For  Shumac  there  is  more  enquiry,  and  about  1000  bags  Sicily  sold,  chiefly  to  arrive,  at  extreme  rates.  Argols  are  scarce,  and  command  high  prices.  Tartar  has  again  advanced,  Cream  having  been  sold  at  12.55,  grey  at  9.55,  and  common  brown  at  90s  per  cwt.  The  transac transactions  tions transactions  in  Turkey  Madder  Roots  are  too  trifling  to  notice,  but  300  bales  Bombay  are  reported  at  20s  to  335,  with  all  faults,  and  at  37s  6d  per  cwt.  for  sound.  The  business  done  in  Olive  Oil  amounts  to  about  60  tuns,  chiefly  in  the  common  descriptions.  50  tuns  Seal  Oil  are  reported  at  the  quotations,  and  40  tuns  Cod  at  £33  to  £33  lOs  per  tun.  Linseed  and  Rape  Oil  are  quiet,  without  change  in  price.  Spirits  of  Turpentine  are  in  fair  request  at  59s  to  60s  per  cwt.  A  good  demand  still  exists  for  Palm  Oil,  particularly  for  arrival;  about  800  tuns  on  the  spot  have  been  sold  this  week  at  £39  5s  to  £4O,  and  1500  tuns  to  arrive  at  £4O  per  tun.  For  Petersburg  Y.C.  Tallow  the  inquiry  has  been  limited,  but  the  market  is  steady  at  58s  6d  to  598;  about  4(10  pipes  South  American  brought  56s  to  57s  per  cwt.  A  limited  business  has  been  done  in  Lard  at  59s  to  60s  per  cwt.  Nothing  worthy  of  notice  has  taken  place  in  Baltic  Hemp,  but  35  hales  fine  white  Manilla  have  been  sold  at  £5B  per  ton.  No  sales  reported  in  Jute.  COTTON  :  —There  has  been  a  more  general  demand  for  Cotton  this  week  than  for  a  long  time  past,  more  particularly  since  Saturday  last,  the  sales  since  when  having  never  reached  less  than  7,000  bales  per  day.  Spinners  still  buy  merely  for  the  supply  of  their  present  wants,  but  as  they  are  nearly  all  out  of  stock,  their  purchases  now  reach  a  fair  amount;  for  ex export  port export  and  on  speculation  we  have  generally  had  demand  for  about  1,500  bales  a  day  ;  so  that  the  business  upon  the  whole  has  been  quite  sufficient  to  sustain  prices,  and  a  better  tone  and  feeling  has  been  manifested  throughout  the  week.  Political  affairs,  as  regards  the  Eastern  question,  are  as  unsettled  in  ap appearance  pearance appearance  as  ever,  and  the  labour  question,  immediately  affecting  the  Preston  spinners,  is  not'  likely  to  be  arranged  without  a  The  money  market  is  a  little  less  stringent.  On  the  other  hand,  the  reports  concerning  the  American  crop  are  still  somewhat  unfavourable.  American  cotton  has  been  easier  of  sale,  and  all  qualities,  from  middling  to  fair,  are  a  shade  dearer,  more  particularly  New  Orleans  descriptions,  which  are  be becoming  coming becoming  scarce.  In  Brazils  there  is  no  change  whatever  to  no notice.  tice. notice.  Egyptians  are  still  heavy  upon  the  market,  and  difficult  of  sale.  In  Surats  there  has  been  quite  an  extensive  business  doing  for  •consumption  as  well  as  for  export,  buyers  being  tempted  by  low  prices,  and  all  qualities  are  now  a  shade  dearer.  3,750  bales  American,  30  Egyptian,  and  3,050  Surat,  have  been  taken  on  speculation  and  for  export,  and  30,470  bales2by  the  trade.  The  actual  export  consists  of  440  American,  40  Brazil,  &amp;c.,  and  150  East  India  •  in  all  630  bales.  Th  e  im imports  ports imports  for  the  week  ar  e  14,122  bales,  and  the  total  sales  37,300  bales.  Pnowstorrs.—The  transactions  in  Beef  during  the  past  week  have  been  to  a  moderate  extent  only,  without  alteration  in  value.  At  full  prices  there  has  been  rather  more  doing  in  Pork,  and  holders  show  increased  firmness.  Bacon  sells  very  slowly,  owing  chiefly  to•  the  unsuitable  character  of  the  stock  now  left.  In  Shoulders  there  is  no  new  feature.  The  sales  of  Lard  for  the  week•  are  reported  at  50  tons,  at  former  prices.  The  demand  for  Cheese  is  far  from  active,  and  lower  rates  only  induce  buyers  to  come  forward.  Linseed  Cake  is  in  active  demand.  Tallow  is  in  steady  request,  at  the  quotations.  The  Corn  Market  has  assumed  a  much  quieter  aspect,  and  prices  for  all  articles  have  slightly  given  way  under  a  pressure  to  effect  sales  by  speculators  desirous  of  realizing  a  profit;  many,  holders,  however,  display  much  firmness,  and  anticipate  higher  rates.  We  quoted  a  decline  on  Tuesday  of  Id  per  70  lbs.  on  Wheat,  and  is  to  is  6d  per  barrel  on  Flour,  but  yesterday  prices  improved,  and  at  To-day's  market  there  was  a  steady  business  transacted  at  the  recovered  rates  of  this  day  week,  ending  with  a  decidedly  upward  tendency.  STAMPS  ON  PROMISSORY  NOTES.—A  question  having  been  put  to  the  office  of  Inland  Revenue,  whether  a  promissory  note  payable  on  demand,  but  not  to  bearer,  drawn  on  a  penny  stamp,  with  the  impression  be  a  legal  security,  Mr.  Keogh  has  replied  I  am  directed  by  the  board  to  inform  you  that  the  promissory  note  referred  to,  is  wholly  worthless,  and  cannot  be  properly  stamped,  even  on  payment  of  a  penalty.  The  recent  Act  of  Parliament,  imposing  a  duty  of  ld.  on  draughts,  or  orders  for  payment  of  money  to  the  bearer,  or  to  order  on  demand,  has  nothing  whatever  to  do  with  promissory  notes,  the  duties  on  which,  are  unaltered  by  that"
