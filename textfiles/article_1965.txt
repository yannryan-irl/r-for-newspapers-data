"DOCK  COMMITTEE,  The  weekly  meeting  of  this  committee  was  held  yesterday,  CHARLES  TURNER  .  ,  Esq.,  in  the  chair.  The  other  members  present  were,  Messrs.  Barber  Big Bigham,  ham, Bigham,  Ldngsdale,  Littledale,  Rankin,  Robinson,  Steele,  Tobin,  Royden,  Gregson,  Evans,  Brocklebank,  Shand,  and  Rounthwaite.  The  CHAIRMAN  informed  the  committee  that  he  had  at attended  tended attended  the  commissioners  who  met  at  St.  George's  Hall  on  Wednesday,  with  the  solicitor,  the  treasurer,  and  the  secre secretary,  tary, secretary,  to  give  any  information  with  respect  to  the  local  dues  on  shipping.  The  commissioners  stated  that  they  had  re.  ceived  full  information  about  all  matters  connected  with  the  pdrt,  and  that  their  principal  object  to  opening  the  Court  was  to  hear  anything  that  parties  might  wish  to  say.  Upon  . STYLE=superscript  q,  several  gentlemen  who  attended  Prom  Birkenhead  complaint-  _  sas  tc  _le  injurious  effect  which  the  dock  laws  had  upon  their  shipping.  He  (the  chairman)  answered  these  complaints  as  far  as  he  Was  able  ;  and  he  thought  his  explanation  was  satisfactory,  and  that  any  proceeding  on  the  part  of  the  commissioners  would  not  affect  the  dock  estate.  The  sub-committee  of  works  recommended  that  the  vacant  land  which  had  been  enclosed  between  the  railway  station  and  Blundel-street,  be  let  to  Mr.  Stubbs  for  the  purpose  of  making  spars  ;  removable  at  a  month's  notice  at  any  time— timeconfirmed.  confirmed. timeconfirmed.  They  also  recommended  that  the  committee  assent  to  the  application  of  Richardson,  Brothers,  for  per permission  mission permission  to  store  2000  tons  of  coal  on  the  west  side  of  Wel Wellington  lington Wellington  dock,  the  coals  to  be  piled  under  the  direction  of  the  Harbour  Master—confirmed.  The  offer  of  Mr.  Abrahams,  to  take  up,  level,  and  repair  the  street  at  the  south  end  of  George's  dock,  and  to  complete  the  same  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  surveyor  within  three  weeks  after  the  tender  was  declared,  was  accepted.  The  offers  of  Messrs.  Jackson  and  Smith,  to  supply  a  scale  and  beam  complete,  for  weigh weighing  ing weighing  palm  oil,  and  also  one  for  fine  goods;  of  Messrs.  Jones  and  Abraham  fo  r  s  u  pplyi  ng  provender  ;  and  of  Norris  and  Co.,  for  supplying  single  and  double  straps  for  driving  machinery,  were  accepted.  Permission  was  granted  to  the  surveyor  to  let  George's  dock  dry  on  the  30th  instant.  It  is  more  than  five  years  since  it  has  undergone  that  opera operation.  tion. operation.  In  the  warehouse  department  the  sub-committee  re recommended  commended recommended  that  the  salary  of  Mr.  Cowan,  Superintendent  of  the  Albert  dock  warehouses,  be  raised  £lOO  per  annum.  The  Chairman,  at  the  request  of  Mr.  Bigham,  read  Mr.  Cowan's  application  for  the  increase,  in  which  he  stated  that  for  the  eight  years  he  had  been  in  the  service  of  the  com committee,  mittee, committee,  he  had  reduced  the  expenditure,  in  labour  and  sala salaries,  ries, salaries,  one-third  ;  and  that  he  saved  them  £5OO  a-year  in  re repairing  pairing repairing  the  warehouses.  He  also  stated  that,  in  addition  to  his  other  duties,  which  were  very  onerous,  the  whole  depart department  ment department  being  entirely  under  his  control,  he  was  also  in  a  mea measure  sure measure  surveyor  of  ships  and  dock-master.  Mr.  ROBINSON  hoped  the  committee  would  agree  to  the  recommendation,  for  if  they  were  to  search  Liverpool  they  could  not  find  a  man  more  fitted  for  the  duties  of  his  office  than  was  Mr.  Cowan.  The  trustees  might  indeed  be  very  active  and  business-like,  but  yet  it  would  be  impossible  to  prevent  great  waste  taking  place,  unless  by  the  supervision  of  a  vigi vigilant  lant vigilant  officer.  Mr.  EVANS  said  it  was  with  reluctance  that  he  declared  he  was  one  of  the  sub-committee  who  had  opposed  the  recom recommendation.  mendation. recommendation.  He  considered  that  what  Mr.  Cowan  received  was  quite  sufficient,  and  he  should  ask  the  surveyor  what  had  been  the  repairs  done  to  the  warehouses  that  Mr.  Cowan  could  have  effected  so  great  a  saving.  Mr.  HARTLEY  was  not  aware  of  any  repairs  unless  those  which  the  cranes  might  require,  or  work  of  that  kind.  Mr.  EVANS  continued  to  say  that  the  evil  tendency  to  im immense  mense immense  salaries,  now  so  prevalent,  should  be  checked.  They  had  been  going  on  day  after  day  increasing  the  salaries,  and  they  were  every  hour  in  the  council  discovering  such  quanti quantities  ties quantities  of  merit,  that  he  declared  he  was  now  afraid  of  merit.  (Laughter.)  As  it  was  observed  upon  one  occasion,  Liver Liverpool  pool Liverpool  was  one  of  the  most  fortunate  places  in  the  world,  for  not  only  did  they  discover  in  every  man  whom  they  em employed  ployed employed  the  greatest  merit,  but  they  also  discovered  that  he  was  the  only  man  in  creation  who  could  do  their  work.  He  did  not  know  of  these  situations  that  if  the  parties  were  di divested  vested divested  of  them  to-morrow,  they  would  not  use  every  in influence  fluence influence  to  get  them  again,  and  at  the  present  salaries.  Mr.  LANGSDALE  observed  that  whatever  Mr.  Cowan  might  think,  he  considered  neither  the  place  nor  the  man  worth  the  money.  It  was  only  a  few  weeks  ago,  that  Mr.  Cowan  applied  for  fifty  guineas,  merely  for  shifting  from  one  house  to  another,  and  he  was  really  one  of  those  men  with  whom  they  would  never  be  done.  Mr.  BIGHAM  Considered  the  application  a  most  unfortunate  one,  particularly  when  they  had  but  just  had  the  accounts  of  the  Albert  warehouse  before  them.  That  statement  of  ac accounts  counts accounts  might  be  satisfactory,  but  certainly  the  result  was  not  satisfactory.  In  one  paragraph  Mr.  Cowan  said  that  the  whole  success  of  the  dock  depended  on  himself;  but  if  the  success  were  to  be  judged  by  the  results  of  the  year,  Mr.  Cowan  had  certainly  not  much  to  boast  of.  He  was  a  most  excellent  servant,  as  indeed  were  all  in  their  employment  ;  but  he  (Mr.  Bigham)  hoped  that  their  observations  would  go  forth  into  the  council  chamber,  and  have  a  due  effect  there,  where  they  were  most  wanted.  Mr.  Cowan  at  present  had  £6OO  a-year.  The  OIAIRMAN  :  Only  £5OO,  and  we  propose  to  give  him  £6OO.  Mr.  ROBINSON  :  A  promise  was  made  when  he  accepted  the  situation  that  his  salary  would  be  raised.  Mr.  EVANS  :  A  promise  !—I  was  no  party  to  any  pro promise.  mise. promise.  Mr.  BIGHA.III  observed  that  if  Mr.  Cowan  were  to  resign  to-morrow,  and  that  they  advertised,  they  would  receive  a  hundred  applications  from  men  quite  competent  for  the  situ sitution,  tion, sitution,  for  it  did  not  require  any  extraordinary  talent,  w  h  o  would  be  glad  to  perform  the  duties  for  £3OO  or  £4OO  a-year.  - STYLE=superscript  The  CHAIRMAN  said  that  Mr.  Cowan  performed  his  duties  in  a  very  efficient  manner,  and  the  superintendence  of  a  de department  partment department  of  this  kind,  involved  very  onerous  and  very  disa disagreeable  greeable disagreeable  duties.  And  look;ng  to  the  way  in  which  Mr.  Cowan  performed  them,  he  did  nit  co  ns  id  er  £5O  O  a-year  too  muchfor  his  services.  His  (the  Chairman's)  opinion  was,  that  they  should  give  him  the  advance.  With  respect  to  the  coals,  Mr.  Austin,  the  chief  clerk,  had  coals  allowed  him,  and  the  sub-committee  only  wished  to  put  Mr.  Cowan  on  the  same  footing  in  that,  particular.  Mr.  BIGHAM  said,  that  less  than  a  fortnight  ago,  he  applied  that  the  salary  of  an  assistant  light-house  keeper  might  be  raised.  He  only  received  12s.  a  week,  and  out  of  that  he  had  to  pay  3s.  a-week  for  the  ware  and  tare  of  his  shoes,  he  having  to  walk  several  miles  every  day  across  a  stoney  road,  to  the  place  of  his  employment.  His  friends  had  to  supply  him  with  clothes,  and  yet  when  he  (Mr.  Bigham)  applied  for  an  increase  to  his  salary,  he  was  told  that  the  man's  salary  could  not  be  raised  at  all,  because  he  had  his  chance  of  promotion.  But  here  was  a  man  who  had  £5OO  a-year,  a  house,  and  coals,  and  yet  it  was  proposed  to  increase  his  salary  at  a  time  when,  from  the  efficient  manner  in  which  he  had  performed  his  duties,  the  receipts  from  the  dock  had  dwindled  down  to  almost  nothing.  - STYLE=superscript  They  could  not  afford  to  give  an  increase  of  salary  to  a  man  on  12s.  a  week,  and  now  they  proposed  to  increase  that  of  a  man  on  £5OO  a-year.  It  was  really  too  bad.  The  CHAIRMAN  did  not  really  see  what  the  question  of  an  assistant  light-house  keeper  had  to  do  with  the  question  of  the  duties  of  a  superintendent  of  a  large  warehouse  of  this  kind.  The  real  question  was  whether  they  were  properly  paid,  and  if  either  was  not,  he  should  be.  Mr.  BARBER  said  that  he  was  present  at  the  meeting  of  the  harbour  committee,.  and  he  was  under  the  impression  that  the  motion  was  for  an  increase  of  £5O  a  year.  Mr.  BROCKLEBANK  conceived  that  Mr.  Cowan  would  not  be  overpaid  if  he  got  an  addition  of  £lOO  a  year.  His'  duties  were  very  onerous,  and  were  daily  increasing,  the  tonnage  received  into  the  dock  having,  up  to  the  present  time,  exceeded  that  of  last  year  by  45,000  tons.  Mr.  ROBINSON  remarked  that  for  some  time  they  had  not  had  a  complaint  about  the  management  of  the  dock,  and  that  the  estate  was  becoming  so  prosperous,  that  a  reduction  of  the  rates  was  about  being  sought  for.  Mr.  BARBER  had  nothing  to  say  against  Mr.  Cowan;  but  he  was  aware  that  the  parties  at  the  head  of  those  departments  had  to  go  through  a  certain  apprentice apprenticeship  ship apprenticeship  to  learn  their  business,  and  that  while  doing  so,  much  loss  had  occurred  to  the  estate.  It  was  not  therefore  fair  that  when  they  had  learned  their  business  at  the  expense  of  the  estate,  they  should  turn  round  at  the  first  moment  and  seek  for  an  in increase  crease increase  of  salary.  He  was  of  opinion  that  £5OO  a  year  was  quite  sufficient  for  the  ordinary  detail  work  which  Mr.  Cowan  had  to  do,  for  up  to  the  present  he  was  not  aware  that  there  was  not  a  dock  master  at  the  Albert  dock.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  There  is  a  dock  master  there.  Mr.  BARBER  :  Then  Mr.  Cowan's  statement  as  to  his  additional  duties  in  that  respect,  is  wrong,  and  his  claim  to  thc  increase  so  much  the  less.  A:vote:was  then  taken  on  the  proposition,  when  there  appeared  for  thelncrease  9,  against  it  6r.  The  reconunenda reconunendation  tion reconunendation  wax  accordingly  adopted.
