"LONDON  CORN  MARKET.-YESTERDAY  The  supply  of  all  sorts  of  grain  this  week  has  been  moderate.  Although  there  were  several  country  wheat-buyers  at  market  this  morning,  nevertheless  the  attendance  was  smaller  than  we  have  been  used  to  of  late,  and  the  business  transacted  was  only  limited,  but  the  full  prices  of  Monday  were  obtained.  In  float floating  ing floating  cargoes  from  the  south  them  did  not  appear  to  be  any  transactions.  Barley,  beans,  and  peas  bring  Monday's  rates."
