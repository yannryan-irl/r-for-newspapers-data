A  DOG  BITING  A  POLICEMAN.—Thomas  Burns,  pawn pawnbroker's  broker's pawnbroker's  assistant,  Crown-street,  was  charged  with  having  set  a  dog  to  worry  John  Swarbrick,  police  officer  714,  on  the  12th  instant.  Mr.  Block  appeared  for  the  defendant.  It  appeared  that  about  three  o'clock  on  the  morning  in  question,  the  policeman  found  the  door  of  the  defendant's  premises  open,  and  knocked  for  some  time  to  arouse  the  residents.  The  defendant  at  last  with  the  dog,  w  hi  c  h  r  an  at  the  came  out  oliceman  and.  bit  him.

Evidence  of  a  similar  character  was  given  by  parties  residing  in  the  neighbourhood.  Mr.  Walter  said  he  only  applied  for  a  remand  for  seven  days,  that  the  defendant  might  have  time  to  leave  the  house,  and  enter  into  recognizances  for  her  future  conduct.  Mr.  Mansfield  granted  the  application,  and  the  defendant  was  'Ordered  to  appear  in  court  again  next  Wednesday.
