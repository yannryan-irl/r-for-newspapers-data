"PHILHARMONIC-HALL  There  are  many  complaints  bout  dear  food,  and,  dear  everything,  just  now,  but  we  have  not  met  with  any  one  who  has  the  hardihood  to  assert  that  dear  music  is  among  our  present  miseries,  when  Mr.  Thomas  provides  us  with  a  delightful  musical  treat,  in  the  -  performance  of  a  full  band,  each  individual  of  which  is  a  master  on  his  particular  instrument,  and  the  strains  of  accomplished  voca vocalists,  lists, vocalists,  and  these  too,  administered  in  one  of  the  nobleso  temples  of  sound  in  the  universe.  Mr.  Thomas  began  this  week,  with  extraordinary  ',eclat,  and  a  full  house,  with  the  Nights  of  Shakspere,  and  with  Mendelssohn.  Miss  P.  Horton  was  the  exponent  of  the  poet,  and  the  band,  and  Miss  Stott,  and  a  small  chorus,  rendered  the  music.  It  is  fashionable  to  'believe  that  no  one  but  a  Semble  could  or  can  read.  This  is  an  error,  as  all  can  testily  who  heard  Miss  Horton  on  Monday.  Delicacy,  discernmezt,  force,  and  pathos,  were  all  found  there  in  their  hest,  and  from  grave  to  was  a  transition  easy  as  it  was  appropriate  to  'the  text.  The  entertainment  was  novel  amongst  us,  but  we  consider  it  perfectly  successful;  so  much  so  that,  on  Friday,  Mr.  Thomas  repasts  the  per performance,  formance, performance,  and  we  would  recommend  all  blessed  with  the  power  to  feel  the  charms  of  so  charming  a  union  of  poe-  try  and  music,  to  attend.  On  Tuesday,  Miss  Horton"
