"MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL  LIVERPOOL,  .  TUESDAY  EVENING.  The  repeated  announcements  of  the  arrival  of  bullion  which  we  are  called  on  to  make,  are  scarcely  lessurgent  or  important  than  the  ,satis ,satisfactory  factory ,satisfactory  intelligence  we  receive  from  abroad  respect respecting  ing respecting  the  supplies  of  corn.  From  France,  we  learn  that  the  government  has  very  considerately  granted  provisions  to  the  proprietors  of  pigs  to  feed  their  stocks  gratis,  on  the  acorns  •of  the  royal  forests.  ThiS  measure  will  very  materially  economise  the  grain  and  potato  supplies.  From  Paris,  we  find  that  while  the  price  of  bread  has  been  rising  there,  a  fall  has  taken  place  in  the  Gers  and  Tarn-et-  Garonne,  the  Basses  Pyrenees,  and  the  other  neighbouring  departments.  At  Miranda  the  fall  has  been  3fr.  the  hectolitre.  And  what  is  still  more  satisfactory,  it  is  now  admitted  that  the  quality  of  the  wheat  this  year  is  superior  to  that  of  the  preceeding  year,  giving  from  15  to  20  per  cent.  more  in  bread.  By  the  lalest  advices  from  Ancona  it  appears  that  the  yield  of  wheat  has  been  this  year,  in  that  province  one-third  less  than  in  1852,  namely,  86,601  measures  (rubbia),  in  place  of  134,192.  But  no  corn  whatever  has  been  alloWed  to  leave  the  province  during  the  present  year,  a  large  quantity  of  foreign  grain  has  been  imported  into  it  already.  From  Madrid  we  learn  that  the  price  of  Wheat  had  fallen.  from  •50  to  40  and  45  real  per  fanega.  From  the  Bannat  the  latest  news  states,  that  this  year  the  harvest  is  more  than  sufficient  for  the  wants  of  Austria,  and  that  a  great  quantity  of  corn  can  be  exported.  In  Hungary  prices  are  falling.  While  the  price  of  bread  at  Brussels  for  the  next  week  is  fixed  at  49c  the  two-pound  loaf  first  quality.  This  is  the  substance  of  the  European  intelligence  which  will  be  conveyed  to  America  from  these  several  points  by  the  next'  mail,  and  the  influence  it  must  have  on  prices  must  be  clearly  foreseen  ;  while  it  ought  to  serve  as'a  guide  to  our  own  markets.  We  still  recommend  caution.  We  yesterday  gave  a  return  of  Cotton  on  sea,  from  the  United  States  to  and  we  have  now  to  report  the  quantity  of  gold  on  sea  from  Aus Australia  tralia Australia  to  this  country  as  follows  :  Ounces.

The  specie  brought  by  the  Charlotte  Jane  ,  is  ascertained  to  be  worth  155,2881.,  which  makes  the  aggregate  amount  received  from  Australia  within  the  last  two  days,  411,2881.,  which  does  not  include  the  amount  brought  by  the  Portland  Bay,  which  has  not  yet  been  reported.  •  The  London  Stock.

The  business  done,  however,  was  of  a  speculative  character.  Consols  for  money  and  time  were  done  at  91,-1  to  911.

There  was  little  done  in  Foreign  Stocks,  with  the  exception  of  Mexicans,  which  rose  1  per  cent.,  owing  to  the  receipt  of  a  telegraphic  message,  by  way  of  New  Orleans  and  &lt;  Boston,  that  the  Mexican  Government  had  arranged  for  the  immediate  payment  of  one  dividend,  and  a  remittance  of  50,000/.  had  been  sent  forward  for  that  purpose  by  the  English  packet  to  Col.

The  Liverpool  Cotton  Market  was  not  so  brisk  to-day,  as  it  was  yesterday,  but  prices  were  well  sustained.  The  sales  amount  to  5,000  bales,  of  which  500  were  taken  for  export.  Our  Share  Market  showed  some  slight  indication  of  revival  but  the  business  done  was  of  a  specula speculative  tive speculative  and  limited  kind.  We  again  repeat  that  a  bet better  ter better  state  of  things  may  be  anticipated,  and  that  speedily.
