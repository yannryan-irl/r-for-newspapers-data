Chairman.  You  have  had  considerable  experi experice  ce experice  in  the  treatment  of  felons  and  other  prisoners,  and  have  Lde  trison  discipline  the  object  of  much  consideration  ?

I  would,  on  his  arrival,  delicately  of  course,  what  had  been  his  previous  ind  tastes.  If  he  could  read,  which  I  would  discover  tle  stratagem  (such  as  placing  a  letter  in  his  hand  zing  him  what  he  made  of  the  address,  as  it  puzzled  some  other  gentle  device),  I  would  cause  amusing  o  be  placed,  during  the  night,  in  his  cell,  and  secretly  d,  so  as  not  to  put  him  under  obligation.  If  he  of  read,  poor  fellow,  I,  or  my  wife,  or  my  daughter,  should  read  to  him  whenever  he  chose  to  ring  for  us,  and  I  would  accord  him  the  indulgence  of  a  pipe,  if  he  wished  it.

The  bath  should  be  recommended  to,  but  not  forced  upon  him,  and  if  he  preferred  a  warm  bath  in  his  cell,  with  Eau  de  Cologne  in  the  water,  I  should  naturally  order  it.  For  his  health's  sake,  I  should  advise  his  adhering  .egular  hours  of  meals,  but  if  he  desired  a  glass  of  sad  a  sponge  cake,  or  an  ice  and  wafers,  or  oysters  nd  stout,  between  meals,  it  would  be  inhuman  to  refuse  it.  The  bill  of  fare  should  be  brought  to  him  each  morning,  and  any  :reasonable  suggestions  he  might  make  for  its  alteration,  he  should  see  were  attended  to.
