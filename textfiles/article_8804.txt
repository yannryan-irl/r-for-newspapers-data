"FAILURE  OF  THE  PEACE  PROPOSALS.  Despatches  from  Vienna  state  that  all  the  journals  published  in  that  city  yesterday  evening  speak  of  the  new  state  of  affairs  as  most  serious,  unexpected,  and.  alarming.  The  whole  personnel  of  the  Russian  Embassy  have  received  orders  to  leave  Vienna.  Hopes  are  still  entertained  at  Berlin  in  some  quarters  that  the'attempt  at  negociations,  having  gone  so  far,  will  not  suddenly  be  thrown  aside."
