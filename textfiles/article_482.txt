(KALE.--During  Sunday,  from  an  early  hour,  a  terrific  gale  prevailed  in  Belfast,  causing  much  damage  to  the  houses  of  the  town,  as  well  as,  it  is  to  be  feared,  to  the  shipping  on  the  coast.  In  the  harbour,  where  rarely  a  gust  disturbs  the  ship shipping,  ping, shipping,  the  Osprey  and  Bolivar  broke  from  their  moorings,  but  were  secured  without  sustaining  or  inflicting  any  damage.  The  steam-dredge  broke  loose,  with  only  oue  man  on  board,  who,  in  a  state  of  most  amusing  alarm,  raised  a  white  cloth,  as  a  flag  of  distress,  which  insi  aid  from  the  quays.  The  Blenheim  bore  gale  in  the  passage  from  Liverpool,  and  proved  her  admirable  qualities  as  a  sea-boat,  by  an  excellent  run  in  the  very  teeth  of  the  tempest.  For  the  greater  portion  of  Sunday  night  the  gale  continued,  and,  it  is  to  be  apprehended,  that  there  are  nu numerous  merous numerous  disasters  on  the  coast  —Northern  Whig.  -  FROM  THE  LONDON  GAZETTE  TUESDAY.
