"MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL,  LIVERPOOL,  WEDNESDAY  EVENING.  By  the  steamer  Arctic  we  are  in  possession  of  advices  from  the  United  States  two  days  later  than  those  contained  in  our  telegraphic  despatch  of  Monday  last.  The  Arctic  _brings  89  passengers,  and  401,358  dollars  on  freight.  Her  commercial  and  monetary  intelligence  is  important.  In  the  progress  of  business  the  rise  in  breadstuffs  re reported  ported reported  by  telegraph,  per  Niagara,  consequent  upon  the  news  brought  out  by  the  Franklin,  was  not  maintained,  holders  began  by  asking  an  advance  of  from  12-i-  to  181  cents  ;  upon  these  terms  but  few  operations  could  be  effected,  and  consequently  prices  receded.  It  is  thought,  however,  by  many  of  the  merchants,  that  Only  for  the  scarcity  of  money  a  great  business  would  have  been  done.  The  advices  taken  out  by  the  America  had  caused  a  rise  of  181  cents  for  best,  and  121  cents  for  common  flour  brands  ;  but  these  advances  must  give  way  to.the  pressure  for  money.  The  money  market  is  said  to  have  gained  strength,  but  there  was  the  same  difficulty  in  borrowing;  only  call  loans  could  be  effected,  and  these  almost  at  the  same  high  rates  of  interest—say  12  to  14  per  cent.  The  stock  market  has  shown  some  improve improvement,  ment, improvement,  but  its  continuance  is  doubtful.  Bills  on  London  active  in  demand  at  109  k  to  109  k,  inferior  have  been  done  as  low  as  1071.  •  The  cotton  market  was  dull  but  firm.  In  the  political  world  it  is  said  to  be  understood  that  Secretary  Guthrie  is  in  favour  of  a  reduction  of  the  duty  on  iron  of  all  kinds  to  25  per  cent.  ad  valorem.  It  is  also  said  he  will  recommend  that  salt,  dye-stuffs,  mahogany,  and  other  furniture  woods,  raw  silks,  crude  drugs,  and  fruits  be  put  on  the  free  list.  Freights  were  firm,  but  not  very  active.  To  Li Liverpool-15,000  verpool-15,000 Liverpool-15,000  bushels  wheat  -  were  engaged  at  120.  in  bulk  and  ship's  bags,  and  17,000  ditto  in  ship's  bags  at  13d.  3,000  to  4,000  barrels  flour  were  engaged  - STYLE=superscript  at  3s.  6d.,  and  5  tons  bee's  wax,  at  id.  The  large  amount  of  specie  brought  by  this  steamer  has  excited  the  astonishment  of  the  Lon London  don London  Standard,  which  says  :—The  Arctic  brings  about  400,000  dollars  in  specie,  which  is  rather  extraordinary.  as  with  the  present  rate  of  exchange  no  profit  can  be  made  from  the  transmission  of  specie  from  either  side.  Here  our  contemporary  falls  into  the  universal  error.  He  takes  the  course  of  exchange  as  calculated  by  the  parliamentary  value  of  gold,  while  the  Americans  deal  with  it  as  a  commodity;  and  where  they  find  that  it  is  not  worth  more  in  their  market  than  about  735.  6d.  the  ounce,  whereas  we  give  about  775.  9d.  the  ounce  for  it  ;  then,  as  a  matter  of  course,  ships  it  to  this  country,  and  they  will  continue  to  do  so  as  long  as  we  can  afford  to  take  it.  Gold  is,  in  fact,  the  best  paying  commodity  they  can  ship  at  this  moment.  •  The  London  Stock  Market  was  less  steady  to today,  day, today,  and  a  decline  in  prices  was  submitted  to.  Consols  closed  95i  to  951;  Reduced,  94*;  New  31  per  cents.,  961  to  95*;  South  Sea  New  Annuities,  1001;  Bank  Stock,  218  :  Unfunded  Debt,  6s.  to  9s.  prem.;  and  India  Bonds,  ls.  to  4s.  prem.  Business  in  the  foreign  house  was  almost  sus sustained  tained sustained  to  day,  still  there  was  a  demand  for  Stocks  at  low  rates,  which  was  not  acceded  to.  Russians  continue  111  to  113  ;  Mexicans,  251  to  254.  In  Sardinian  Bonds  there  were  bargains  at  911:  92.  Dutch  Fours  at  951.  The  Share  Market  has  been  heavy  t  o  -d  a  y,  an  d  prices  in  many  instances  have  declined.  A  few  of  the  principal  stocks  have  maintained  the  advance  of  yesterday.  North  British,  31;  Midlands  at  631;  Manchester  and  Sheffield,  222  ;  Great  Northerns  were  dealt  in  at  86  to  86k  ;  Caledonians  from  Vi Vito  to Vito  561  ;  Great  Westerns,  831  to  83  ;  Lancashire  and  Yorkshire,.67-3-  to  661;  N.  Westerns,  1032  to  103;  Grand  Trunk  of  Canada  Shares  rose  10s.  to  15s.  again  today  ;  Great  Luxembourgs,  l  18  to  101;  ditto  Railway,  61  7;  ditto  Guaranteed,  48  ;  Sambre  and  Meuse  7  1-,  per  cent  lower  than  yesterday;  West  Flan Flanders,  ders, Flanders,  a  lower.  There  was  a  renewed  demand  for  Crystal  Palace  Shares,  which  fetched  2*  2.1  prem.  Australian  Agricultural  Company's  Shares  at  45  to  The  Manchester  Monthly  Circulars  speak  in  re remarkably  markably remarkably  encouraging  terms  of  the  coming  pros prospeets  peets prospeets  of  trade.  The  changes  of  values  then  during  the  month  have  been  inconsiderable.  We  quote  7-Bths  Printers  and  9-Bths  Madapollams  at  about  last  month's  prices;  9  Bths  Printers  and  Shirtings,  a  little  lower  in  some  instances;  low  qualities  of  India  Shirtings  and  Jaconets  about  as  before  ;  the  better  descriptions  of  India  Jaconets,  as  also  China  Shirtings,  Brocades,  and  Figured  Shirtings,  some something  thing something  lower;  T  Cloths  &amp;  Domestics  as  having  re  ceded  a  little  in  many  cases,  and  Longcloths  as  having  receded  more  decidedly  in  price.  Money  is  less  stringent  than  for  a  month  or  two  previously.  There  is  no  further  change  in  the  minimum  rate  charged  by  the  Bank  of  England  ;  but  money  is  more,  abundant,  and  the  rate  more  easy  in  the  Discount  market.  Anxiety  as  to  the  future  course  of  money  is  materially  lessened,  and  the  demand  for  accommodation  has  become  less.  Meanwhile  large  importations  of  the  precious  metals  take  place  weekly.  The  Liverpool  Cotton  Market  was  quiet  again  to-day,  and  prices  were  firm.  The  sales  amounted  to  6,000  bales,  of  which  1,000  were  taken  on  specu speculation  lation speculation  for  account.  The  Share  market  opened  lower  than  the  closing  rates  of  Tuesday,  and  in  the  course  of  the  forenoon  prices  receded  still  further.  As  the  day  progessed  a  firmer  tone  was  observable  and  prices  closed  steady  and  well  supported  at  quotations  rather  above  the  lowest  point.  The  prevalence  of  sales  not  bona  fide  still  continues.  In  London  to-day  Copper  was  quoted  at  an  ad advance  vance advance  of  101.  per  ton.  Scotch  Pig  Iron  and  Tal Tallow,  low, Tallow,  dull  at  rather  under  yesterday's  currency.  On  the  subject  of  Iron,  the  Moniteur  publishes  a  decree  which  fixed  the  duty  on  Foreign  Coke  brought  to  France  at  30  centimes  for  every  100  kilogrammes  in  French  vessels,  and  80  centimes  in  foreign  vessels.  The  duty  on  raw  cast  Iron,  is  fixed  at  5  francs  per  100  kilogrammes,  and  charg  ing  duties  on  other  sorts  of  Iron.  After  1855  the  duty  on  raw  cast  Iron  will  be  4  francs,  and  on  other  sorts  of  iron  in  proportion."
