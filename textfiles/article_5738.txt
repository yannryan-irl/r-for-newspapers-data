"LIVERPOOL  CORN  EXCHANGE.-YESTERDAY.  Sharp  frosts  have  again  given  way  to  a  damp  and  equally  chilly  atmosphere,  and  the  condition  of  new  WHEATS  in  the  agricultural  districts,  so  much  complained  of  since  har harvest,  vest, harvest,  continues  without  improvement,  while  the  estimate  of  deficient  yield  and  inferiority  of  quality  appears  to  have  been  rather  under  than  over-rated;  these  objectionable  cir circumstances  cumstances circumstances  may  have  contributed  to  the  further  decline  in  many  of  the  country  markets  this  week,  as  regards  home homegrown  grown homegrown  Wheat,  whilst  other  descriptions  have  undergone  but  little  depression  ;  in  the  large  importing  markets,  particu particularly  larly particularly  on  this  side  of  the  kingdom,  a  continuance  of  greater  firmness  is  manifested  ;  and,  as  the  report  of  the  closure  of  the  Baltic  ports  is  now  confirmed,  and  that  of  the  interior  navigation  of  America  immediately  expected,  with  scarcely  any  old  Wheat  left  in  store  at  the  former,  and  a  much  smaller  quantity.  of  Wheat  and  Flour  than  usual  on  the  sea seaboard  board seaboard  of  the  latter,  it  seems  not  improbable  that  supplies  on  the  way  from  each  direction,  large  as  the'shipments  may  have  been  for  several  consecutive  weeks,  will  be  met  by  a  good  demand,  more  especially  since  millers,  as  long  as  causes  for  depression  seemed  to  exist,  have  withheld  from  opera operations  tions operations  of  any  magnitude  as  much  as  possible.  The  late  de decline  cline decline  in  Wheat  and  Flour  in  this  market  has  already  brought  forward  buyers  to  some  extent,  chiefly  for  consumption  ;  the  quantity  at  hand  of  the  former  has  facilitated,  but  the  limited  stock  offering  of  the  latter  has  restricted,  the  trans transactions  actions transactions  of  the  past  two  days,  though  rather  more  money  would  have  been  given.  Hitherto  the  receipts  of  Wheat  from  America  have  preponderated  over  those  of  Flour;  for  what  little  may  be  shipped  during  the  winter,  the  opposite  propor proportions  tions proportions  will  prevail.  We  have  a  fair  import  of  OATS  and  OATMEAL  from  Ire Ireland,  land, Ireland,  but,  otherwise,  the  fresh  arrivals  of  all  articles  are  quite  insignificant.  _  _  At  our  - STYLE=superscript  Exchange  this  morning,  there  was  a  large  attend attendance  ance attendance  of  town  and  country  buyers  :  an  evident  disposition  was  shown  to  increase  stocks,  and  an  extensive  business  with  consumers  has  taken  place  in  WHEATS,  at  an  improvement  of  ld  to  2d  per  701bs,  over  the  currency  of  Tuesday  last;  a  number  of  parcels  was  also  taken  to  hold  over.  In  FLOUR,  likewise  ;  a  good  deal  has  been  done,  6d  to  9d  per  barrel  advance  being  readily  obtained,  and  buyers  find finding  ing finding  difficulty  in  executing  orders.
