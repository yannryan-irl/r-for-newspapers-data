The  following  report  was  read  :  The  Committee  of  the  Liverpool  School  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb  have  much  pleasure  in  announcing  to  its  supporters  that  the  gradual  increase  in  its  usefulness  which  they  have  had  to  record  in  their  recent  annual  reports  has  attained  its  highest  point  in  the  year  just  closed—the3oth  year  of  the  institution's  existence.  The  number  of  pupils  which,  in  1851,  was  only  40,  has  risen  during  the  past  year  to  double  that  number.  At  the  end  of  the,  year  1853  the  school  contained  65  pupils  ;  a  year  ago  the  aggregate  was  66;  and  tbis—the  highest  nnmber  ever  up  by  new  admissions,  'tint  ot  annual  subscriptions  is  stationary;  Jseriptions  are  not  more  he  constant  loss  to  the  who  had  previously  ons  as  the  1.  with  a  To  enable  them  to  pay  off  this  amount,  the  committee  now  appeal  to  the  subscribers  and  the  public.  'That  so  large  a  debt  conclrNion  which  they  cannot  tiller  themselves  to  entertain.  The  School  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb  in  Liverpool  has  attained  to  such  a  reputation,  not  only  in  this  country,  but  on  the  continents  of  Europe  and  America,  that  even  as  a  matter  of  local  interest,  a?art  from  higher  considerations  of  the  sacred  work  in  which  it  is  engaged,  the  committee  feel  that  they  may  venture  to  prefer  a  claim  upon  their  townsmen  to  maintain  it  unimpaired  in  its  present  high  Position.  _  henefit  i  -  All  the  objects  which  excite  the  zeal  of  philanthropy  and  the  efforts  of  Christian  beneficence  seem  to  be  united  in  the  deaf  and  dumb;  and  it  follows,  that  an  institution  which  aims  at  ameliorating  their  naarral  condition,  has  a  corresponding  claim  upon  the  philanthropic  and  the  benevolent  of  all  classes  of  the  community.  The  reformation  of  those  who  know  no  the  instruction  of  those  who  know  nothing;  the  mission  of  the  gospel  to  those  who,  even  in  their  deep  affliction,  have  no  knowledge  or  conception  of  its  sublime  hopes,  and  blessed  consolations  the  reception  of  the  orphan,  the  foundling,  and  (where  there  seems  a  pros prospect  pect prospect  of  improvement)  of  the  semi  -imbecile,  when  to  these  calamities  is  added  that  of  being  deaf  and  dumb  also  ;  the  training  of  dispositions  which  might  else  become  lamentably  perverted,  and  the  cultivation  of  faculties  which  must  otherwise  wither  and  die  out  for  want  of  exercise  —all  these  are  the  objects  to  which  this  institution  is  devoted,  and  in  the  attainment  of  which  its  highest  honours  have  been  won.  Its  fruits  are  visible,  and  may  be  seen  by  those  who  wish  to.have  the  evidence  of  actual  inspection  before  responding  to  this  appeal.  All  persons  who  feel  an  interest  in  the  subject  arc  respectfully  invited  to  satisfy  themselves  by  3  visit  to  the  institution*,  where,  as  well  as  by  the  president,  the  chairman,  and  other  members  of  the  committee,  donations  and  subscrip subscriptions  tions subscriptions  in  support  of  the  charity  will  be  gratefully  received  and  acknowledged.  The  report  was  unanimously  adopted  ;  and  after  pass passing  ing passing  certain  formal  resolutions,  the  meeting  separated.  *  The  school  is  open  for  the  inspection  'of  visitors  every  Tuesday,  from  ten  to  twelve  o'clock  in  the  forenoon,  and  from  two  to  five  in  the  afternoon;  and  on  other  days  by  an  older  from  a  subscriber  or  life  member.
