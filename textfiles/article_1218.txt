"COUNTY  CO  URT.  v  --ESTERDAY,  ,  .  His  Honor,  JOSEPH  POLLOCK;  Esq.,  sat  at  ten  o'clock,  yesterday.  Several  commitment  summonses  were  disposed  of,  none  of  which  presented  any  .  public  importance.  The  Court  then  proceeded  to  take  up  insolvent  cases.  In  re  MEYER.—Hermann  Christian  Meyer,  a  German,  was  opposed  by  Mr.  Hime,  on  behalf  of  Messrs.  and  Jaffa,  and  by  Messrs.  Smith,  Halliday,  Henderson,  Clarke,  Ward,  and  other  creditors.  Mr.  Hughes  'appeared  for  the  insolvent.  It  appeared  that  the  insolvent  had  taken  a  house  in  Moorfields,  and  subsequently  in  Renshaw-street,  as  a  restaurant  and  victualler's  establishment.  Not  being  pos possessed  sessed possessed  of  capital,  he  had  incurred  several  debts  for  the  fitting  up  of  the  prethises,  and  the  speculation  proved  a  failure.  Mr.  Hime  asked  for  a  suspension  of  the  petition  upon  the  ground  that  the  insolvent  had  embarked  in  a  business  speculation  without  being  possessed  of  capital  sufficient  to  enable  him  to  carry  it  on,  and  that  he  had  induced  several  parties  to  give  him  credit  upon  statements  that  he  was  possessed  of  certain  property,  which  did  not  afterwards  appear.  Mr.  Hughes  urged  that  the  insolvent  had  been  led  into  the  speculation  through  ignorance  of  the  business  of  this  country,  and  that  no  dishonesty  whatever  was  attributable  to  him  iroughout  the  whole  of  the  transactions.  His  H  ONOR  said  if  he  thought  the  insolvent  had  been  led  into  the  folly  which  he  had  committed  by  ignorance  of  the  country,  he  would  look  upon  his  conduct  in  d  different  light  from  that  in  which  he  was  now  compelled  to  view  it.  But  in  whatever  country  the  insolvent  was  placed,  he  should  have  known  that,  as  an  honest  man,  he  should  not  have  taken  upon  himself  engage engagements  ments engagements  which  he  had  no  prospect  of  being  able  to  discharge.  If  the  creditors  thought  it  their  interest  to  ask  for  a  dismissal  of  the  petition,  he  should  have  great  difficulty  in  refusing  to  accede  to  their  request,  but  he  believed  they  all  considered  it  more  for  their  interest  that  the  estate  should  be  administered..  He  could  not  think  that  the  insolvent  was  misled  by  igno ignorance  rance ignorance  of  the  country,  or  its  language,  into  undertaking  a  busi business  ness business  without  any  capital,  and  making  representations  to  his  creditors  which  were  not  borne  out  by  fact.  The  insolvent  must  have  known  perfectly  well  that  he  had  not  the  means  of  carrying  on  business  for  the  length  of  time  by  which  alone  such  an  experiment  could  be  expected  to  succeed.  Whether  by  a  native  of  this  country,.  or  by  any  other,  that  Court  could  not  sanction  the  embarking  in  business  when  a  man  had  really  no  means  of  carrying  it  on,  especially  when  he  had  lucrative  and  respectable  employment  in  a  depart department  ment department  in  which  he  was  qualified  to  obtain  a  livelihood.  The  Court  should  therefore  suspend  the  final  order  for  nine  months,  withhold  protection  for  two  months  from  that  time,  and  di direct  rect direct  that  the  estate  should  be  administered.  Mr.  Hughes  urged  that  the  insolvent  should  be  granted  the  protection  to  enable  him  to  carry  on  his  business.  The  Court  enquired  what  the  opinion  of  the  creditors  was,  and  as  a  majority  of  them  appeared  to  desire  that  the  protection  should  bo  granted,  decided  upon  allowing  it  to  the  insolvent  for  three  months,  to  be  renewed  from  time  to  time.  Some  other  insol insolvent  vent insolvent  cases  of  no  public  •  importance  were  then  disposed  of.  Interpleaders  were  then  taken  up.  In  re  LoNasuAw.—Mr.  Almond  appeared  in  behalf  of  Mr.  Thompson,  claimant,  and  Mr.  Hime  for  the  execution  creditor.  It  appeared  that  the  claimant  was  lessee  of  a  public  house,  in  which  there  were  certain  fixtures,  a  beer-engine,  some  tables,  and  other  articles  which  he  claimed  as  his  property.  These  articles  were  seized  under  execution  by  the  creditors  of  Longshaw,  to  whom  the  interest  in  the  house  was  transferred  in  1852.  It  was  urged  upon  behalf  of  the  claimant  that  the  fixtures  had  continued  to  be  his  property  during  the  different  transfers  which  took  place  of  the  public  house.  Mr.  Thompson  was  briefly  ex examined  amined examined  to  prove  his  claim.  The  Court  ruled  that  there  had  been  no  proof  that  the  property  belonged  to  Longshaw,  the  execution  debtor  ?  and  in  favour  of  the  claimant.  The  Court  adjourned  at  one  o'clock  to  ten  o'clock  this  morning.  LIVERPOOL  MARKETS—MONDAY.  (Written  expressly  for  the  Northern  Daily  Times.)
