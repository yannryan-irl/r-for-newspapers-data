H.,  with  the  view  of  CURTAILING  SOME  OF  THE  BRANCHES  OF  ins  BUSINESS,  has  decided  upon  DISPOSING  of  his  Stock  of  CHANDELIERS  FOR  GAS,  OIL,  &amp;c.,  and  begs  to  inform  his  Friends  and  the  Public,  that  the  Stock  has  not  only  been  completely  reassorted,  but  the  whole  of  the  prices  have  been  very  considerably  reduced,  thereby  offering  every  possible  inducement  to  give  him  the  preference  in  selection.  Articles  of  the  best  manufacture  have  been  marked  at  prices  so  low,  that  those  cf  the  most  inferior  description  could  not  be  purchased  at  the  same  rate,  even  by  wholesale.

A  large  Stock  of  PURE  COLZA  OIL,  IMPORTED  DIRECT  PROM  THE  CONTINENT,  kept  entirely  for  Ihe  accommodation  of  F.  L.

H.  takes  the  opportunity  of  st•rting,  that  those  Persons  wile  may  hitherto  have  bean  deterred  from  viAting  his  Establishment,  by  its  great  event  and  the  valuable  Collection  of  Goods,  are  not  aware  that,  by  overcoming  this  impression,  (in  reality  a  prejudice,)  the  result  would  be  most  advantageous  to  them,  as  they  would  find  that  they  can  purchage  Art.eles  of  a  b  tter  quality,  and  at  Lower  Prices,  than  at  any  other  Establishment.  He  considers  it  almost  superfluous  to  add,  that,  whether  they  make  Purchases  or  other otherwise,  wise, otherwise,  they  will,  in  every  case,  be  received  with  politeness  and  atten attention.  tion. attention.
