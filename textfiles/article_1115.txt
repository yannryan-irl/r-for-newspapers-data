The  Cotton  market  is  said  to  have  been  activ  e STYLE=superscript  and  firm  at  former  prices,  but  the  business  doll°  was  not  important.  The  present  position  of  the  American  None!'  market  appears  to  be  quite  as  anomalous  a  s  our  own.

The  London  Stock  Exchange  though  recovcrill  from  the  recent  panic,  is  very  f  ar  f  ro  th  b  e  ing  settled;  and  the  business  done  is  of  a  very  specs;  lative  character.
