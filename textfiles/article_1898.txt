The  principal  object  of  the  commissioners,  therefore,  in  coming  to  Liverpool,  was  to  afford  to  any  person  interested  in  the  matter,  an  opportunity  of  making  any  statement  or  observation  connected  with  it,  - STYLE=superscript  which  he  might  wish  to  address  to  the  commissioners.  As  regards  the  information  which  we  desire  to  obtain,  as  I  said  before,  really  there  is  hardly  anything  which  has  not  been  already  furnished  to  the  Commissioners.  Mr.  CHARLES  TURNER  said  as  chairman  of  the  dock  committee,  he  attended  there  with  the  dock  solicitor  and  secretary,  for  the  purpose  of  giving  her  Majesty's  commis commissioners  sioners commissioners  information.  If  there  were  any  information,  on  any  point  required  by  the  commissioners,  they  should  be  happy  to  give  it.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  The  returns  are  so  full,  and  in  every  respect  so  entirely  complete,  really  we  have  but  one  or  two  questions  to  put.  We  will  finish  our  part  of  the  enquiry,  and  after  that  we  shall  be  prepared  to  hear  any  remarks  any  person  wishes  to  make.  The  TOWN  CLERK  said  the  answers  which  the  commis commissioners  sioners commissioners  had  received  from  him,  related  merely  to  the  dues  which  were  received  by  the  corporation.  The  answers  were  not  at  all  applicable  to  dues  received  by  the  trustees  of  the  docks.  The  CHAIRMAN  separate  things  No,  I  am  quite  aware  they  are  two  A  docl  Mr.  BRAMAH,  Secretary  to  the  Birkenut— Birkenuttrustees,  trustees, Birkenuttrustees,  wished  to  ask  whether  Birkenhead  was  included  in  the  :remarks  made  by  the  chairman,  relative  to  this  enquiry.  The  representatives  of  Birkenhead  docks  had  received  a  number  of  inquiries,  to  _which  they  had  replied,  and  he  thought  •fit  to  volunteer  some  remarks  with  respect  to  levying  town  dues  on  tonnage  at  Birkenhead  docks  ;  and  he  had  only  to  ask  that  if  the  commissioners  were  satisfied  that  the  representation  he  had  made,  brought  the  matter  clearly  before  the  commissioners,  and  that  it  would  form  a  part  of  the  report,  he  had  nothing  further  to  trouble  the  committee  with.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  commissioners  th  oug  ht  th  ere  was  a  doubt  on  the  question,  or  if  it  were  not  sufficiently  clear  on  their  minds.  -  -  _  to  the  real  operation  and  effect  of  this  thing,  he  should  prepared  to  call  witnesses  who  would  set  the  matter  .rfectly  straight  before  them.  Mr.  POWLES  asked  whether  the  commissioners  would  hold  enquiry  in  Birkenhead  ?  Iu  that  case  they  should  take  a  ifferent  course  here,  if  it  was  the  intention  of  the  commis commisioners  ioners commisioners  to  hold  an  enquiry  in  Birkenhead.  Had  they  any  such  intention  ?  The  CHAIRMAN  :  No,  the  observations  I  made  had  refer reference  ence reference  to  the  answers  received  to  the  questions,  sent  by  the  commissioners.  Those  answers  are  very  full  and  complete,  both  as  regards  Liverpool  to  which  I  alone  addressed  my  ob observations  servations observations  at,the  time  and,  I  may  add,  they  are  perfectly  complete  as  regards  Birkenhead.  It  is  not,  at  present,  the  intention  of  the  commissioners  to  hold  a  local  court  of  en enquiry  quiry enquiry  at  Birkenhead,  and  it  will  be  obvious  that  any  observa observations  tions observations  which  those  interested  in  Birkenhead  may  wish  to  ad address  dress address  to  the  Commissioners  with  respect  to  the  Liverpool  docks  ;  it  is  much  better  they  should  be  addressed  to  the  commissioners  in  Liverpool  than  in  Birkenhead.  It  will  give  an  opportunity  to  parties  in  Liverpool  to  reply  to  the  observations  if  they  think  it  desirable.  With  reference  to  what  has  fallen  with  regard  to  Birkenhead,  the  commission commissioners  ers commissioners  think  it  better  that  any  observations  which  you  may  make  or  bring  before  their  notice  with  respect  to  the  effect  of  the  Liverpool  dues  on  Birkenhead,  should  be  addressed  to  them  here,  for  the  same  reason  as  stated  before,  it  would  give  the  opportunity  of  further  remarks.  the.  BRAMA.H  said  nothing  further  only  bringing  it  for forward.  ward. forward.  He  did  not  mean  to  occupy  their  time  and  reiterate,  viva  voce,  what  he  had  returned  to  the  commissioners  in  writ writing.  ing. writing.  He  had  nothing  more  to  say  if  his  answers  had  esta established  blished established  in  their  minds  the  existence  of  the  fact.  The  CHAIRMAN  thought  it  would  be  more  satisfactory  if  the  fact  were  stated  then.  Mr.  TURNER  said  the  commissioners  had  received  no  an answer  swer answer  from  the  dock  committee.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  I  know  we  have  not.  Mr.  TURNER  should  like  to  address  a  few  observations  about  the  dock  corporation,  - STYLE=superscript  which  was  not  a  beneficial  one  at  all.  The  CHAIRMAN:  The  fact  is  the  docks  of  Liverpool  are  regulated  by  act  of  parliament.  Mr.  TURNER  :  By  several.  Mr.  NORTH  :  As  the  chairman  has  just  explained  you  have  not  received  any  return  to  questions  sent  to  the  Liverpool  dock  trustees,  for  the  reasons  which  I  will  shortly  explain  if  I  may  be  allowed  to  do  so.  I  gathered  both  from  the  terms  of  the  commissioner,  and  beside  from  what  passed  at  the  board  of  trade,  when  the  dock  chairman,  the  town  clerk,  and  myself,  had  the  honour  of  an  interview  with  Mr.  Cardwell  on  the  subject  of  the  commission,  and  still  more  from  the  terms  of  the  act  of  Parliament  itself,  forbidding  the  mortgage  and  charge  of  shipping  rates  with  a  view  to  the  present  enquiry.  I  collected  that  the  object  of  this  commission  was  principally,  if  not  exclusively,  to  enquire  into  such  charges  levied  on  shipping,  as  the  shipping  trade  might  not  receive  a  corresponding  benefit  from  ;  and  I  felt,  therefore,  that  the  enquiry  was  foreign  entirely  .  to  the  con constitution  stitution constitution  of  the  Liverpool  dock  estate,  which  is  a  separate  corporation  existing  under  acts  of  parliament,  from  the  time  of  Queen  Anne  downwards,  managed  by  a  committee  of  twenty-four  members,  of  whom  one-half  are  elected  by  the  dock  ratepayers,  and  half  the  number  by  the  town  council  out  of  their  own  body  ;  and  whose  funds  are  received  and  applied  exclusively  for  the  beneficial  purposes  of  the  manage management  ment management  and  maintainance  of  the  docks  and  harbours  of  Liver Liverpool,  pool, Liverpool,  without  any  private  interest  or  emolument  whatever.  I  felt,  therefore,  that  the  answers  to  those  enquiries,  so  far  as  the  dock  committee  are  concerned,  as  you  have  indicated,  are  contained  in  the  volume  of  statutes,  which  regulate  their  whole  proceedings.  Their  history  may  be  compressed  into  half-a-dozen  of  words.  They  levy  under  those  acts  of  par parliament,  liament, parliament,  tonnage  dues  on  shipping,  and  dues  on  goods,  to  the  amount  of,  in  round  numbers,  £300,000  per  year,  which  is  applied,  as  I  have  already  said,  exclusively  for  the  pur purpose  pose purpose  of  promoting  the  interest  of  the  port  and  harbour.  It  is  hardly  for  any  purpose  which  may  not  be  considered  only  local,  but  national  :  the  ships  not  only  of  the  whole  king kingdom,  dom, kingdom,  but'  of  every  maritime  country,  having  the  same  advantage  and  the  same  use  of  the  Liverpool  docks  that  our  shipping  has.  With  that  explanation  which  I  have  taken  the  liberty  of  making,  I  did  myself  the  pleasure  of  calling  (d.  your  office,  in  Loudon,  three  months  ago,  but  I  found  you  had  then  gone  on  your  circuit.  T  then  made  the  same  ex explanation  planation explanation  to  your  clerk,  but  I  could  receive  no  authority  from  him,  and  I  told  him  I  would  take  the  opportunity  of  laying  this  statement  before  the  committee,  and  take  your  opinion.  If,  after  what  I  have  stated,  anything  is  required  from  the  dock  committee,  which  is  germ=  to  the  object  of  this  enquiry,  we  shall  gladly  give  it.  We  have  nothing  to  conceal,  we  wish  for  every  publicity.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  You  have  an  annual  account  of  the  dock  committee  ?  Mr.  Nonni  :  The  annual  accounts  are  Printed  and  pub published,  lished, published,  and  laid  before  parliament.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  That  printed  account  and  this  act  of  par parliament  liament parliament  contain  everything  ?  Mr.  NORTH  :  Everything.  I  can  give  you.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  In  fact  they  answer  all  our  ques questions.  tions. questions.  _  _  .  Mr.  NORTH  :  I  think  so,  entirely.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  The  result  is  the  same.  The  commis commissioners  sioners commissioners  have  before  them,  as  far  as  I  am  aware,  the  fullest  information  they  require,  with  regard  to  the  decks.  I  think  it  right  to  prevent  misapprehension,  that  I  should  state  the  commissioners  do  not  quite  concur  in  the  view  you  (Mr.  North)  take  of  the  object  of  the  commission,  Their"
