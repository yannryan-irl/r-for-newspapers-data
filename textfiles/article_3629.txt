CorroN.—The  only  new  feature  bearing  upon  Cotton  is  to  be  found  in  the  American  accounts,  which  report  the  occur occurrence  rence occurrence  of  a  frost  in  some  of  the  Cotton  districts,  although  at  present  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  injury  of  moment  having  been  sustained  ;  however,  as  prices  continued  high,.  and  the  receipts  and  shipments  were  unusually  light,  some  little  effect  has  been  produced  upon  our  market  during  the  last  tii  days.  The  mills  at  Wigan,  Preston,  Burnley,  &amp;c.,  are  still  closed,  and  the  consumption  consequently  is  largely  diminished,  hence  spinners,  light  as  their  stocks  are,  take  only  a  limited  quantity  out  of  the  Market,  but  as  the  buying  for  export  and  speculation  has  been  rather  more  than  usual  of  late,  the  business  reaches  a  fair  extent,  and  amounts  to  46,000  bales.  American  descriptions  generally  have  been  pretty  steady,  and  the  middle  qualities  particularly,  or  Cotton  at  about  5',  7  d.  to  6d.  per  lb.  being  scarce,  and  much  run  upon,  are  dearer  by  1-16  to  1-8  per  lb.

There  has  been  a  good  demand  for  Swats,  and  large  sales  have  been  made  at  slightly  better  prices,  the  market  having  recovered  from  .  the  depression  of  the  preceding  week.  6960  bales  American,  120  Brazil,  120  Egyptian,  and  4960  Surat,  &amp;  c  .,  have  been  taken  on  s  p  ecu  l  a  ti  on  and  for  Export;  and  32,900  bales  by  the  trade.  The  actual  Export  consists  of  380  American,  30  Brazil,  &amp;c.,  and  1,540  East  India—in  all  1,950  bales.  The  imports  for  the  week  are  9170  bales.  PitcvisioNs.—The  fine  descriptions  of  beef  have  this  week  attracted  more  attention,  and  sales  to  a  fair  extent  are  re reported  ported reported  at  full  prices;  ordinary  qualities  continue  neglected.  Pork  sells  slowly,  without  change  in  value.  There  is  a  moderate  retail  demand  for  bacon,  and,  in  the  absence  of  arrivals,  the  stock  slowly  reduces.  Lard  is  a  slow  sale,  at  last  week's  quotations;  holders,  however,  show  no  disposition  t.  y  the  market,  The  :d  eman  d  for  fine  Cheese  is  toler tolerably  ably tolerably  active,  but  secondary  sorts  are  difficult  to  sell.  At  a  farther  decline  of  is  per  cwt.  Tallow  is  very  dull.  Linseed  Cake  is  rather  easier.  There  has  been  a  very  quiet  week  in  the  Corn  Market,  the  sales  being  confined  to  the  consump consumptive  tive consumptive  purchases  of  the  millers  and  dealers.  Prices  in  a  few  instances  have  been  in  favour  of  buyers,  but  generally  holders  are  very  firm,  and,  as  the  stock,  especially  of  Flour,  is  small,  there  is  a  growing  feeling  that  higher  rates  are  to  be  looked  for.  To-day  the  market  was  steady,  but  not  very  active."
