"from  the  bottom  a  „essing  —ucs,  the  feeling  of  gratitude  and  almost  of  astonishment,  under  which  he  laboured  at  the  present  moment,  at  the  kind  reception  which  had  been  given  to  him,  and  the  feelings  which  his  friends  had  expressed,  feeling  which  seemed  to  pervade  the  whole  ward,  with  re regard  gard regard  to  his  services  for  the  last  three  years,  during  which  he  had  the  honour,  the  high  honour,  of  being  a  member  of  the  Town  Council  of  the  first  town  in  Her  Majesty's  do dominions  minions dominions  (applause).  Did  he  not  feel  deeply  grateful  for  such  an  expression  of  sentiments  upon  the  part  of  his  fellow  electors,  he  should  be  totally  unworthy  of  the  high  position  in  which  they  were  pleased  to  place  him.  Three  years  a  the  electors  of  that  ward  took  him  by  the.  hand,  and  s  him  an  inexperienced  man  into  the  Town  Council  of  ,Liv  pool.  _  -dss  anything  beyond  what  he  was  performing  (Hear,  hear).  s  was  not  the  first  party  to  propose  the  bargain,  and  a  similar  document,  if  not  more  numerously  signed—he  did  not  at  this  moment  recollect  the  number  of  signatures  but  con containing  taining containing  a  large  majority  of  electors'  names,  which  wished  him  to  come  forward  and  represent  them,  was  presented  to  him.  He  did  so  very  ;reluctantly,  for  he  knew  his  own  in inability  ability inability  to  perform  the  duties  with  that  degree  of  efficiency  which  a  member  should  possess,  representing  a  ward  like  Pitt  street,  some  persons  were  pleased,  to  call  that  an  insig insignificant  nificant insignificant  ward,  but  he  thought  the  names  attached  to.that  very  memorial  would  at  once  contradict  such  an  assertion,  and  prove  to  the  town  that  however  insignificant  the  humble  individual  who  now'  addressed  them  might  be,  he  was  called  upon  to  come  forward  by  anything  but  insignificant  names  (Applause).  That  he  had  merited  their  esteem  by  his  humble  services  during  the  past  three  years  was  indeed  to  him  a  source  of  high  gratification.  Having  spoken  of  what  had  been  done,  he  would  not  say  that  he  had  exerted  him himself  self himself  in  the  manner  which  had  been  stated  by  his  kind  friends,  but  he  had  done  simply  his  duty,  and  would  that  he  could  render  that  duty,  and  would  that  he  could  render  that  duty  a  greater  service  to  those  who  nolv  surrounded  him.  (Ap (Applause).  plause). (Applause).  As  he  had  done  his  best,  however,  he  was  sure  they  .  would  readly  acquit  him  for  not  having  done  more  than  lay  in  his  power  to  do.  With  regard  to  the  present  struggle,  it  appeared  to  him  that  it  was  Pitt  Street  ward  which  was  destined  to  strike  the  first  blow,  to  fire  the  first  dart  in  every  struggle  whether  parliamentary  or  municipal.  (Hear,  hear).  An  address  whichhe  had  seenplacarded  upon  the  walls,;relating  to  that  ward,  was  the  first  announcement  of  a  contest  at  the,  approaching  municipal  elections  which  he  had  seen  in  Liver Liverpool.  pool. Liverpool.  Since  then  he  had  seen  another—a  solitary  one.  Since  they  had  been  kind  enough  to  present  him  with  a  memorial  again,  pledging  themselves,  as  they  had  done,  that  every  exertion  should  be  made  to  send  him  'back  again  to  the  place  from  whence  he  came  (laughter),  he  hoped  that  he  had  gained  something  by  the  experience  of  the  past  three  years,  and  in  gratitude  to  those  gentlemen  who  had  so  kindly  brought  him  forward  again,  he  should  only  say,  that  any  experience  he  had  gained  during  the  Vast  three  years,  should  be  devoted  to  their  interest  with  all  the  'energy  he  possessed  of  mind  and  body.  (Applause).  ,  And  if  Providence  should  spare  him  to  see  the  end  of  these  three  years  '  he  to  serve  them,  and  theyto  be  his  masters,  he  hoped,  that  if  he  did  not  receive  a  memorial  of  that  description,  to  ask  him  to  stand  again,  he  should  at  least  merit  the  thanks  of  those,  whom  he  felt  proud  in  his  heart  to  call  his  neighbours  and  fellow fellowelectors—his  electors—his fellowelectors—his  friends  of  the  Pitt-street  ward.  (Loud  applause).  MT.  WAGSTAFF,  Mr.  HENDERSON,  Mr.  J.  GLADSTONE,  and  Mr.  CARSWELL,  briefly  addressed  the  meeting  for  the  pur purpose  pose purpose  of  bearing  their  warm  testimony  to  the  merits  and  services  of  Mr.  Jeffreys  in  the  Town  Council.  The  CHAIRMAN  asked  whether  •  any  elector  desired  to  put  a  question  to  Mr.  Jeffreys  ?  Mr.  MURRAY  requested  that  Mr.  Jeffreys  would  give  some  explanation  regarding  his  vote  for  increase  of  salaries  in  the  Town  Council.  Mr.  JEFFREYS  said  that  for  the  past  twelve  months  wages  had  advanced  favourably  throughout  England,  and  when  he  found  that  a  recommendation  came  unanimously  from  the  Finance  Committee,  composed  of  the  very  elite  of  the  Council,  to  increase  the  salary  of  the  Town  Clerk,  he  should  feel  very  sorry  to  .  grudge  a  trifling  advance  to  ono  who  had  been  a  most  efficient  officer,  who  had  saved  the  Corporation  thousands  upon  thousands,  and  still  continued  to  do  so.  (Hear.  hear).  The  CHAIRMAN  expressed  his  approval  of  the  course  Mr.  Jeffreys  had  taken,  an  d  e  xplained  that  at  the  time  of  the  municipal  reform,  salary  of  the  Town  Clerk  had  been  fixed  at  £2,000  instead  of  £2,500  by  a  majority  of  only  one,  it  being  held  out  at  the  time,  that  atia  future  period  it  would  be  raised.  He  also  explained  that  the  duties  of  the  Town  Clerk  were  very  much  increasing,  and  that  should  he  become  at  any  time  incapacitated  from  continuing  to  perform  the  duties  of  his  office,  the  Council  were  not  ins  situation  to  give  him  a  retiring  pension,  as  they  might  do  in  regard  to  some  others  of  their  officers.  (Hear,  hear).  Mr.  WAGSTA.FF  said  he  had  also  voted  for  the  increase  of  the  salaries  of  the  Town  Clerk  and  other  officers.  He  went  prepared  to  vote  against  the  increase  ;  but  upon  conviction  he  voted  for  it.  He  did  not  he  hoped,  then  prof  of  Thanks  were  then  voted  to  the  Chairman,  amid  loud  ap applause,  plause, applause,  on  the  motion  of  Mr.  CALLIS,  seconded  by  Mr.  GLAD GLADSTONE  STONE GLADSTONE  ;  and  the  CHAULMAN  having  acknowledged  the  com compliment,  pliment, compliment,  the  proceedings  ended.
