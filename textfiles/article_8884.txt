MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL.  -•-  LIVERPOOL,  WEDNESDAY  EVENING  There  has  been  a  better  feeling  in  the  Cotton  market  to-day,  and  rather  more  business  has  been  done,  the  sales  reaching  7000  bales,  of  which  1500  have  been  taken  for  speculation  and  export.  The  Liverpool  Share  Market  opened  with  con considerable  siderable considerable  briskness  upon  the  advance  in  Consols  and  the  Peace  rumours,  and  the  improvement  continued  until  late  in  the  afternoon,  when  a  slight  reaction  took  place  upon  the  im impression  pression impression  that  the  Bank  would  raise  the  rate  to-morrow  :—Aberdeen,  101  1L  Chester  and  Birkenhead,  121-,  13&amp;.

From  this  amount  the  directors  now  recommended  a  dividend  at  the  rate  of  6  per  cent.  per  annum,  and  also  a  bonus  of  5  per  cent  upon  the  paid-up  capital.  After  a  short  discussion  the  report  was  adopted.  The  English  stock  market  to-day  exhibited  great  buoyancy.  The  four  o'clock  quotations  were  about  one  per  cent.eabove  those  current  at  the  same  hour  yesterday.  After  the  official  close  this  afternoon,  a  further  rise  of  one  quarter  per  cent.  was  quoted,  and  prices  stood  at  87  7.16,  87  9-16.  In  explanation  of  this  sudden  upward  movement,  no  tangible  fact  has  transpired.  The  telegraph  failed  to  bring  the  usual  quotations  from  to-day's  Paris  Bourse.  The  wind  having  just  changed  to  the  westward,  the  arrival  of  the  Champion  of  the  and  other  vessels  from  Australia,  is  looked  for.  The  amount  of  specie  brought  in  by  the  La  Platal  from  the  West  Indies,  is  about  171,8001,  of  which  269,537  dollars  is  described  as  sil silver  ver silver  and  589,000  dollars  gold.  The  rise  in  Consols,  and  the  influence  by  which  that  rise  was  occasioned,  have.  exercised  an  important  effect  upon  the  Railway  Share  market.  The  firmness  of  this  market  is  greatly  strengthened  by  the  appearance  of  the  last  half-yearly  dividend  period.

CORONER'S  INQUESTS.—On  Tuesday  morning,  the  atten attention  tion attention  of  constable  518  was  called  by  some  boys  to  the  body  of  a  child,  wrapped  in  a  piece  of  old  cloth,  in  the  brickfields  off  Mersey-street.  It  was  a  full-grown  female  child,  and  from  the  evidence  of  Mr.  Kemp,  surgeon,  it  appeared  that  the  infant  died  of  exposure  to  cold  ;  and  the  jury  returned  a  verdict  of  wilful  murder  against  some  person  or  persons  at  present  unknown.—On  the  body  of  a  child  named  Han Hannah  nah Hannah  liollingbergh,  aged  five  years.  It  appeared  that  the  child  lived  with  its  parents  in  Limekiln-lane,  and  on  Tues Tuesday  day Tuesday  evening  a  large  gate,  at  the  entrance  of  a  yard  near  to  the  house,  fell  on,  and  killed,  the  child.  It  seemed  the  gate  had  been  badly  secured,  and  that  when  the  child  touched  it,  it  fell  on  her.  The  jury,  in  returning  a  verdict,  presented  that  there  is  great  blame  attributable  to  the  owner  of  the  property,  for  allowing  the  gate  to  remain  in  so  dangerous  a  state  as  it  appears  to  have  been  in  during  the  last  fort 'fortnight.'
