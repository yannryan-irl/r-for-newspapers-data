"THE  GREAT  ONSLOTV  MINES.  We  lay  before  our  readers  the  following  impor-  taut  extracts  from  the  Carlisle  Patriot,  as  an  intro-  duction  to  a  few  observations  which  we  shall  take  -  -  an  early  opportunity  to  make  respecting  certain  movements  now  going  on  in  Liverpool  :  •  •  THE  GREAT  ONSLOW  CONSOLIDATED  -  •  .  MINES.  (From  the  Carlisle  Patriot,  Oct.  15.)  Bubble,  bubble,  toil  and  trouble,  Fire  burn,  and  Cauldron  bubble.  We  remember  that  some  twelve  months  ago  it  was  whispered  through  Carlisle  that  a  fortunate  few  in  it  had  been  initiated  into  so  good  a  thing  in  the  deep  mining  way  that  they  were  to  be  enriched  out  of  hand.  Pretty  tolerable  things,  it  was  said,  had  been  done  in  California  ;  and  the  Australian  digoins,  barring  the  voyage  of  eighteen  thou thousand  sand thousand  miles,  held  out  promises  not  altogether  dark  but  that  the  real  El  Dorado  lay  much  nearer  home  ;  to  wit,  in  cer certain  tain certain  copper  mines,  in  the  Parish  of  Breward,  near  Camelford,  in  the  County  of  Cornwall,  extending  over  several  hundred  acres  of  land,  held  under  a  lease  from  Sir  Ily.  Onslow,  Bart.,  for  21  years,  from  the  7th  Feb.  1851,  at  1-18th  dues  or  royalty  for  the  first  five  years,  and  1-15th  for  the  remainder  of  the  term,  the  small  sum  of  £8  being  the  only  additional  claim  for  rent  or  occupancy,  which,  however,  is  deducted  from  the  dues,  having  nothing  but  the  dues  or  royalty  to  The  authorised  statement  went  on  to  say  that  the  mines  were  worked  at  an  expense  of  several  thousand  pounds,  in  1846,  but  were  then  stopped  on  account  of  the  panic.  That,  On  the  17th  of  Janutiry,  in  the  present  year  (1852),  the  mines  were  reconstituted  into  50,000  shares  at  305.;  the  ,  lessees  unde  r  t  a  ki  ng  t  o  se  ll  10,000  additional  shares  at  '  not  less  than  30s.  a  share,  or  so  many  thereof  as  might  be  necessary  in  order  to  raise  £15,000,  which  sum,  in  -addi -addition STYLE=superscript  tion -addition  to  the  £3OOO  already  received,  is  to  be  appropriated  to  the  further  development  of  the  mine,  and  all  costs  what whatsoever  soever whatsoever  are  to  be  paid  therefrom  until  such  sum  of  £lB,OOO  is  wended  ;  the  full  amount  of  all  sales  from  the  mines  during  the  same  period  it  is  agreed  shall  go  as  dividends.  The  mines  are  worked  upon  the  cost  book  system,  without  any  liability  beyond  the  first  payment.  The  Engine  Shaft  is  sunk  45  fathoms,  and  Bennett's  Shaft  50  fathoms  from  the  surface,  and  is  sinking  to  the  55.  Levels  have  been  driven  about  100  fathoms  at  the  22,  35  and  45  fathoms,  east  and  west.  In  the  former  level  Gozzan,  the  most  certain  and  unmistakable  indication  of  great  deposits  of  copper  ore,  has  been  extracted  in  large  quantities;  in  the  35  fathom  level  there  is  an  immense  body  of  Mundic  over-riding  great  deposits  of  yellow  copper  ore,  and  the  indication  of  the  45  fathom  levels  are  of  a  still  more  satisfactory  and  conclusive  nature  as  to  the  value  of  the  After  more  in  the  same  style,  and  assertions  as  to  the  richness  of  copper  ore  produced,  comes  this  para paragraph  graph paragraph  :  On  the  26th  of  May  last  a  dividend  of  2s.  per  share  was  declared,  arising  from  the  sale  of  mumlic  and  copper  It  will  be  seen  by  what  follows  that  this  statement  is  false.  The  authors  of  it,  however,  had  no  qualms  of  con conscience  science conscience  ;  they  went  on  to  make  assertion  of  great  prospective  profits  to  shareholders,  and  professed  to  quote  the  Daily  News  to  the  eff  ec  t  that  the  35  fathom  shaft  looked  well  for  copper,  and  that  from  it  some  splendid  specimens  of  silver  lead.were  raised  a  few  days  a  assay  of  the  silver  lead  alluded  to  in  the  report  (they  say)  has  been  made  by  10,  Coleman-street,  London,  13th  Sept.,  1853,  THE  GREAT  ONSLOW  CONSOLS  COPPER  MINE.  Gentlemen,—ln  pursuance  of  your  instructions  that  I  should  investigate  the  accounts  of  this  comp  an  y,  an  d  prepare  a  balance-sheet  to  the  30th  June  last,  I  proceeded  to  Wade Wadebridge,  bridge, Wadebridge,  where  certain  books  and  vouchers  of  the  company  were:submitted  to  me  by  Mr.  Webster,  the  secretary.  Having  carried  the  examination  of  the  accounts  as  far  as  I  deemed  essential  under  my  instructions,  and  in  the  absence  of  the  register  of  shares,  transfer  book,  dividend  li  s  t,  an  d  rece  i  p  t  s  for  dividends,  I  beg  to  report,  that  it  appears  from  the  cost  book  that  this  company  was  originally  constituted  as  the  Great  Mitchell  Consolidated  Copper  Mines,  in  5,000  shares,  of  which  it  was  agreed  to  sell  1,000  shares,  at  £3  per  share,  it  was  determined  on  the  6th  March,  1851,  to  call  the  sett  the  Great  Onslow  Consolidated  Mines  ;  and  on  the  17th  Ja January,  nuary, January,  1852,  it  was  agreed  to  increase  the  number  of  shares  to  50,000,  of  which  10,000  (or  so  many  as  would  produce  £15,000)  were  agreed  to  be  offered  to  the  public  at  not  less  than  £1  lOs  per  share,  thus  increasing  the  capital  to  £lB,OOO  0  0  The  payments  appear  by  the  cost  book  to  have  been  as  under  :  From  the  formation  of  the  company  £  s.  d.  to  the  31st  December,  1851  ...  3334  14  7  From  31st  December  1851  to  30th  March  1852  1501  15  11  From  30th  March  1852  to  30th  March  1853  ..  ..  8829  11  2  From  the  30th  March  1853  to  30th"
