"GERMANY.  BERLIN,  Nov.  12.â€”Voss.  Gazette  publishes  the  death  of  General  von  Radowitz.  The  statement  is  incorrect.  The  Baron  appears  to  have  passed  tlnough  a  crisis,  and  is  still  very  feeble.  Yesterday  he  gathered  his  family  around  him,  and  was  also  visited  by  the-King.  To-day  he.  is  something  better."
