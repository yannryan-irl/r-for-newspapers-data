"RELEASE  OF  COLONEL  TURR  The  second  edition  of  the  Times  contains  the  following  Peror  o STYLE=superscript  espatch,  dated  Vi  enna,  yesterday  morning  :  The  Em Em,as  ,as Em,as  a  mark  of  consideration  for  his  illustrious  A  Tu  lly,  Q  ueen  Vi  ctor  i  a,  has  granted  a  pardon  to  Colonel  rr.'  â€”._,,op.,_______  ENGLAND  AND  AMERICA  The  London  Post  thinks  the  news  of  peace  will  at  once  exercise  considerable  influence  on  the  course  adopted  by  President  Pierce  towards  this  country.  Th  e  naval  ith  Power  o  f  E  ngland  comprises  a  force,  in  comparison  w  which  t  h  e  entire  navy  of  the  United  States  is  but  a  weak  and  in  e  ffi  c  i  ent  squadron,  if  by  the  certainty  of  pea  ce  it  be  set  at  liberty,  ready  to  act  in  vindication  of  the  national  honou  r  in  whatever  quarterit  may  be  assailed.  The  change,  therefore,  which  has  recently  come  over  the  drama  of  Europ  ean  po  li  tics  will,  no  doubt,  have  its  proper  weight  it%  all  reflecting  men  in  the  United  states  ;  and  they  will  consider  whether,  in  a  point  of  mere  international  Punctilio,  which  has  been  the  subject  of  explanation  and  MitV,  a  war  should  b  e  ras  h  ly  and  wickedly  provoked,  a  whit;  d  h  would  sweep  Ameri  can  commerce  from  the  seas,  attack  the  whole  sea  b  oar  d  of  the  union  open  to  the  of  the  greatest  naval  force  in  the  world."
