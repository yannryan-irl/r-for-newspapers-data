"LIVERPOOL  EXCHANGE  ROOMS  The  annual  meeting  of  the  tnembers  of  the  Liverpool  Exchange-rooms  was  held  in  the  Cotton  Sale-rooms,  at  twelve  o'clock,  yesterday.

The  Chairman  stated  that  the  accounts  of  receipts  and  dis disbursments,  bursments, disbursments,  for  the  past  year,  differed  but  little  from  that  of  former  years.  There  was  a  little  increase  in  the  amount  paid  for  property  tax,  and  a  little  diminution  in  the  receipts  from  the  sale  of  newspapers,  as  gentlemen  did  not  think  it  worth  their  while  to  take  a  paper  in  the  evening,  at  half  price,  which  they  could  buy  in  the  morning  for  a  penny.  The  next  increase  in  expense  was  for  the  new  plate  glass  windows  in  the  room  below,  which,  he  believed  he  might  safely  say,  had  given  very  general  satisfaction.  There  was  also  a  little  increase  iq  expenditure  for  throwing  open  the  gates,  which  gave  a  better  access  to  the  building.  itt  other  matters,  there  was  very  little  difference;  and  he  was  happy  to  say  that  the  committee  could  safely  recommend  that  the  dividend  should  be  the  same  as  in  former  years—namely,  48  17s  per  share,  with  three  guineas  in  lieu  of  the  right  of  nomination  to  the  news-room.
