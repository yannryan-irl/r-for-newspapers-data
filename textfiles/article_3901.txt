There  is  a  better  general  attendance  of  the  trade  to-day  than  for  several  markets  past.  Foreign  Wheats  have  met  a  more  extended  sale,  and  the  transactions,  though  not  large,  have  been  to  a  fair  extent,  the  value  of  all  fine  qualities  fully  maintaining,  and  that  of  middle  descriptions,  such  as  Medi Mediterranean,  terranean, Mediterranean,  exceeding  by  a  Icl  to  2d  ?  bushel  the  currencies  of  this  day  week.

The  meet meeting  ing meeting  was  numerously  attended.  The  chair  was  occupied  by  the  Right  Hon.  the  Earl  of  Shaftesbury,  and  a  great  . STYLE=superscript  ntim  , STYLE=superscript  ber  of  clergymen  were  present.  SPECIAL  MEETING  OF  THE  SELECT  '  VESTRY—THE  CHARGES  AGAINST  MR.  BRADLEY.  A  special  meeting  of  the  Select  Vestry  was  held  on  y.ester y.esterday,  day, y.esterday,  at  ten  o'clock.  The  Rev.  Rector  CAMPBELL  in  the  chair.  The  other  members  present  were—Messrs.  Whitty,  Gardner,  Bradley,  Denton,  Mellor,  Hand,  Crawford,  Blain,  Shaw,  Hughes,  Kitchen,  Moss,  Hutchinson,  Whitley,  Came.  Mr.  DENTON  begged  to  know  if  they  had  sufficient  grounds  for  such  a  meeting?  With  regard  to  its  object,  having  re reference  ference reference  to  certain  charges  made  against  Mr.  Bradley  in  the  council,  he  (Mr.  Denton)  did  not  think  they  were  justified  in  taking  up  the  subject,  inasmuch  as  it  had  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  them.  The  CLERK  replied  that  the  meeting  had  been  called  in  pursuance  of  a  resolution  of  the  finance  committee.  The  clerk  then  read  the  minutes  of  the  committee,  from  which  it  appeared  that  at  their  last  meeting  Mr.  Bradley  called  attention  to  the  charge  preferred  against  him  by  Mr.  Hodson,  in  the  council,  and  moved  that  a  special  meeting  of  the  vestry  should  be  called  to  consider  whether  any,  and  what,  steps  should  be  taken  in  reference  to  such  charge.  Mr.  CARNE  said,  that  considering  two  members  of  the  board  had  a  right  to  summon  a  special  meeting,  he  had  complied  with  the  representation  of  the  finance  committee  in  doing  so.  The  CHAIRMAN  said,  that  all  that  appeared  in  the  news newspaper  paper newspaper  quoted  by  Mr.  Bradley,  was  that  a  direct  charge  had  been  made  against  him  with  respect  to  his  conduct  in  the  municipal  elections.  That  was  all  he  knew  about  the  matter,  but  he  did  not  think  that  they  could  act  upon  a  vague  speech  reported,  and  most  probably  accurately  reported  in  a  newspaper.  It  was  said,  however,  that  the  council  had  appointed  a  committee  to  investigate  into  Mr.  Bradley's  conduct  ;  but  even  so,  he  could  not  imagine  how  anything  thrown  out  vaguely  by  Mr.  Hodson,  without  specifying  any  particular  '  should  be  an  affair  in  which  the  vestry  was  at  all  concerned.  It  did  not  come  before  them  officially,  and  even  if  it  did  come  before  them  in  such  a  shape,  it  was  so  vague  that  he  did  not  see  how  they  could  undertake  to  investigate  such  a  charge.  They  were  appointed,  for  a  particular  pur purpose—for  pose—for purpose—for  the  transaction  of  parochial  business,  and  this  was  not  parochial  business.  If  the  town  council  should  decide  against  Mr.  Bradley,  then,  perhaps,  the  vestry  might  call  a  meeting  to  consider  what  steps  should  be  decided  upon;  but  at  present  he  should  say,  in  his  humble  judgment,  it  was  a  matter  with  which  they  had  nothing  to  do.  Mr.  GARDNER  observed  that  he  should  have  a  very  poor  estimation,  indeed,  of  Mr.  Bradley  if  he  did  not  call  for  an  investigation  into  his  conduct  by  the  vestry.  There  was  no  doubt  that  they  were  implicated  in  the  charge.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  How  ?  Mr.  GARDNER  :  Mr.  Hodson  said  another  and  we  all  know  that  Mr.  Bradley  is  only.  connected  with  this  board  and  the  council.  Mr.  Bradley,  then,  is  entitled  as  a  member  of  this  Board,  and  as  a  gentleman,  to  call  for  an  investigation  into  this  charge.  Mr.  DENTON  :  I  object  altogether  to  the  principle  you  are  laying  down.  If  it  were  admitted  every  little  squabble  that  takes  place  outside  doors  should  be  brought  before  this  Board  as  a  matter  with  which  we  were  concerned.  Mr.  GARDNER  :  This  is  not  a  squabble  outside—it  is  a  charge  against  a  member  of  this  Board.  .  Mr.  BRADLEY  :  I  did  think  it  my  duty  to  bring  this  mat matter  ter matter  before  this  Board,  inasmuch  as  Mr.  Hodson  has  charged  me  with  having  used  in  my  position  at  this  board  means  to  carry  on  unduly  the  election  of  Councillors.  The  words  are  to  this  But  this  is  not  the  only  case  against  him  ;  for  he  (Mr.  Hodson)  was  sorry  to  say  that  he  knew  of  two  or  more  instances  not  only  in  the  council,  but  in  another  public  body,  in  which  he  was  connected,  and  in  which  he  used  the  influence  of  his  position  to  carry  an  Now,  I  am  not  a  member  of  any  other  board  besides  the  council,  with  the  exception  of  this,  and  it  must  therefore  necessarily  allude  to  my  position  at  this  Board.  And  as  a  member  of  this  board  I  did  consider  that  it  was  my  duty  as  a  public  man  to  bring  before  the  notice  of  this  board  the  public  charge  made  against  me.  It  affects  us  in  two  ways:  first,  as  against  the  Vestry,  who  are  bound  as  a  Board  to  investigate  it  ;  and  secondly,  as  a  charge  personally  against  me,  which  as  sach  you  are  likewise  bound  to  investigate.  I  therefore  upon  both  those  grounds  considered  it  my  duty  to  bring  it  before  your  notice,  so  that  I  might  place  myself  in  your  hands—ln  the  hands  of  the  Board,  to  say  fearlessly  that  this  is  a  charge  groundless  in  every  respect,  either  by  insinuation  or  by  , STYLE=superscript  act.  I  do  think,  that  when  public  men,  at  public  Boards,  are  charged  in  this  kind  of  manner,  affecting  their  personal  character,  it  does  become  a  strict  matter  of  duty  that  the  Board  should  be  composed  of  such  men  that  the  public  could  have  the  fullest  confidence  in  them  (hear,  hear),  in  carrying  out  that  public  duty  which  they  are  authorised  as  a  board  to  perform.  I  don't  know  that  I  have  at  any  time,  while  a  member  of  this  'board,  placed  myself  in  a  posi posiv--  v--- posiv--  -....,tr  grr  to  that  principle.  It  is  for  you  to  say  whether  you  have  seen  any  [dn..,  my  conduct  that  could  have  given  rise  to  such  a  charge.  I  need  not,  my  feel feelings  ings feelings  in  some  degree  are  much  mixed  up  in  a  matter  of  this  kind,  the  more  particularly  when  I  see,  that  in  some  degree  there  is  a  decided  attack  publicly  made  upon  me,  and  that  there  is  not  that  kind  of  sympathy  expressed  which  the  principle  pronounced  and  at  stake  in  the  matter  should  have  called  forth  from  the  public  press  of  this  town,  with  the  exception  of  one  journal.  And  it  afforded  me  very  great  pleasure  to  see,  in  the  Albion  of  yes yesterday,  terday, yesterday,  the  principle  upon  which  these  kind  of  mnttcrs  ought  to  be  undertaken  ;  and  T  do  hope  that  that  principle  may  come  under  the  cognizance  of  the  other  .  papers  of  the  town,  and  then,  if  they  will  do  that,  I  am  quite  satisfied  I  shall  have  that  fair,  strict,  and  impartial  inquiry,  which  I  don't  think,  under  the  surrounding  circumstances  in  which,  as  it  appears  to  my  mind,  that  I  am  placed,  I  should  have.  I  shall  now  say  no  more,  than  that  it  rests  with  this  board  to  say  whether  they  will  permit  a  member  of  this  board  tos tosbe  be tosbe  under  the  unjust  remarks  that  have  emanated  from  Mr.  Hodson  in  his  charge  against  me.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  There  is  no  evidence  before  the  board  to  prove  that  Mr.  Hodson  made  use  of  those  words  ;  and  even  if  he  had  done  so,  it  is  not  at  all  proved  that  they  have  any  reference  to  the  Select  Vestry  ;  and  if  everything  any  man  pleases  to  say,  either  in  a  newspaper  or  in  the  Town-Council,  is  to  be  brought  before  us,  we  shall  have  special  meetings  here  every  week  to  inquire  into  every  description  of  charge.  I,  myself,  have  been  attackedby  a  most  influential  member—influential,  probably,  in  his  own  estimation—of  the  Town-Council;  for  that  in  his  opinion,  I  wouldbe  much  better  employed  in  going  about  through  the  back  streets  of  Liverpool,  than  in  presiding—  I  do  not  know  if  he  did  not  call  it  a  at  all  events,  that  I  could  occupy  my  time  much  better  than  in  presiding  here  on  the  top  of  Brownlow  Hill.  That  was  a  charge  against  me—  Mr.  BRADLEY  :  That  is  a  matter  of  opinion.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  But  I  might  have  called  a  vestry  to  vindicate  my  character  from  such  .an  insinuation  as  that  I  was  grossly  neglecting  my  duty  as  the  Rector  of  Liverpool  in  attending  to  the  select  vestry  instead  of  going  about  the  back  streets  of  Liverpool.  The  word  has  not,  however,  been•  used  by  Mr.  Hodson  at  all.  We  do  not  know  if  he  refers  to  it;  and  therefore  it  is  quite  extrajudicial  on  our  part  to  go  into  this  basin  , STYLE=superscript  ss  at  all.  We  are  appointed  by  law  for  a  specific  purpose  as  guardians  of  the  poor  of  this  parish  to  conduct  its  parochial  business—  Mr.  BRADLEY  :  But  it  is  the  conduct  of  the  business  by  this  board  that  the  charge  affects.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  The  charge  has  reference  to  elections  altogether.  Mr.  BRADLEY  :  Precisely  so.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  It  insinuates  that  Mr.  Bradley  com committed  mitted committed  a  misdemeanor  with  respect  to  the  municipal  elections;  but  it  does  not  say  that  he  committed  a  similar  misdemeanour  with  respect  to  the  select  vestry  elections.  Mr.  BRADLEY  :  If  it  were  a  mere  insinuation  such  as  you  were  alluding  to,  I  would  treat  it  with  the  same  silent  disdain  ;  but  here  is  a  public  charge  affecting  the  acts  of  a  public  man.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  But  not  the  select  vestry.  Mr.  BRADLEY  :  lam  a  member  of  no  other  board,  and  the  charge  is,  that  I  used  the  position  I  have  at  the  board  to  carry  out  certain  matters.  The  C1LA.11012%.1,1  /our  position  to  carry  out  an  election.  What  election  is  rt  ?  I  never  read  anything  so  absurdly  vague  as  it  is.  Mr.  BRADLEY  :  But  take  the  context  of  the  speech.  Mr.  Moss  said  that  he  had  listened  with  interest  to  the  remarks  which  the  chairman  had  made  respecting  his  own  peculiar  case,  and  that  of  Mr.  Bradley,  and  he  confessed  that  he  could  not  see  any  parallel  between  them.  The  observations  that  were  made  by  that  distinguished  member  of  the  council,  whom  he,  (Mr.  Moss)  had  the  honour  to  call  his  friend,  though,  perhaps,  to  some  extent  somewhat  vague,  yet  met  with  his  concurrence.  He  (Mr.  Moss)  also  thought  that  the  clerical  position  would  be  much  more  efficient  if  removed  entirely  from  secular  pursuits,  and  that  it  would  be  better  for  the  chair chairman  man chairman  to  attend  to  his  sacred  functions,  than  to  preside  over  what  he  believed  had  never  been  called  a  That  word  he  (Mr.  Moss)  had  never  heard  from  the  lips  of  Mr.  Robertson  Gladstone,  but  though  the  justness  of  the  observation  might  be  a  mltter  of  opinion,  it  did  not  reflect  on  the  chairman's  private  character  in  any  shape  or  form  ;  but  this,  on  the  other  hand,  was  an  attack  on  Mr.  Bradley's  private  character.  He  was  accused  of  using  the  influence  which  his  position  at  that  board  gave  him  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  elections  out  of  doors.  The  CHAIRMAN  :  What  sort  of  elections  ?  Mr.  Moss  :  Suppose  that  distinguished  member  of  the  council  had  stated  that  you  had  exerted  your  influence  as  chairman  here  to  carry  elections,  how  would  you  have  felt  ?  You  would  have  felt,  as  Mr.  Bradley  feels,  that  there  had  been  a  gross  insult,  and  a  gross  wrong  inflicted  on  your  character.  Without  prescribing  to  Mr.  13radley  or  the  board  what  course  you  should  pursue,  I  think  it  is  neces necessary  sary necessary  that  the  board  should  take  up  this  matter  and  appoint  a  committee,  and  ascertain  the  truth  or  falsehood  of  this  charge  as  the  council  did.  Ido  say  that  if  it  remains  un uncontradicted,  contradicted, uncontradicted,  the  public  will  naturally  conclude  that  Mr.  Bradley  allows  judgment  to  go  by  default,  and  that  he  submits  to  the  charge  because  he  could  not  repudiate  it.  I  do  think  that  this  vestry  should  institute  some  inquiry— inquirythat  that inquirythat  a  communication  should  be  made  to  Mr.  Hodson  demanding  whether  not  or  he  alludes  to  t  his STYLE=superscript  ve  s STYLE=superscript  t  r STYLE=superscript  y  , STYLE=superscript  a  n STYLE=superscript  d  what  particular  charge  he  has  to  bring  against  this  board,  and  not  sit  down,  sub  silentio  in  the  way  the  chairman  suggests.  I  feel  the  position  in  which  Mr.  Bradley  is  placed,  and  I  do  think  that  it  is  the  duty  of  the  board  to  throw  their  mantle  of  protection  around  him,  consistent  with  what  is  right  and  proper.
