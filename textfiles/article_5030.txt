"TO  CORRESPONDENTS  We  are  always  ready  to  insert  in  the  columns  of  this  paper  letters  written  in  a  gentleman-like  and  commercial  spirit.  But  we  cannot  think  of  bestowing  our  valuable  space  on  the  publication  of  the  crude  ideas  of  any  person  who  may  think  he  has  a  right  to  address  a  letter  to  the  Editor  of  a  public  journal.  Whatever  is  intended  for  insertion  must  be  authenticated  .  -  by  the  name  and  address  of  the  writer  ;  not  necessarily  for  publication,  but  as  a  guarantee  of  his  good  faith.  We  cannot  undertake  to  return  rejected  communications.  All  communications,  Books  for  Review,  etc.,  to  be  for forwarded  warded forwarded  to  the  Editor  must  be  addressed  to  the  Publisher,  CHARLES  WILMER,  and  those  from  London  may  be  sent  to  the  care  of  Messrs.  Simpkin,  Marshall,  arid  Co."
