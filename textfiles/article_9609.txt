The  business  passing  in  the  corn  market  during  the  week  has  been  very  limited,  although,  on  Tuesday,  there  was  a  slight  improvement,  especially  in  Indian  corn.  To-day's  market  was  dull  for  all  articles,  at  Tuesday's  prices.

There  were  some  indications  of  recovery  from  the  late  depression,  but  this  might  be  caused  by  the  demand  of  present  wants,  and  the  inadequate  supply  offered.  Wheat  was  a  shade  higher  than  on  Tuesday.  Oats  and  barley  support  the  currencies  of  that  day.

During  the  year  1855  the  institution  numbered  11,310  patients.  The  number  of  deaths  which  occurred  was  329,  and,  what  is  very  remat  ka  •  for  the  benefit  of  the  latter.  He  urged  that  the  owners  were  clearly  obliged  to  pay  that  order  just  as  they  would  have  been  before  the  alteration  of  the  law,  as  if  it  were  not  so,  the  seaman  must  be  defrauded  of  his  wages.  Mr.  Forshaw  argued  that  the  215th  section  of  the  17ta  and  18th  Victoria,  which  enacted  that  if  a  seaman  volunteered  on  board  one  of  her  Majesty's  vessels,  his  clothes  and  wages  should  be  given  over  to  the  captain.  of  the  ship  on  board  which  he  should  volunteer,  pro— provided  vided provided  that  when  the  wages  should  have  been  paid  bT  bill  or  order,  then  that  the  account  an  t-  genera  l,  or  the  , STYLE=superscript  seaman,  should  have  the  same  powers  of  recovering'  by  which  wages  were  recoverable  prior  to  the  passing  of  the  act.  The  fact  was  that  the  government  had,  before  the  passing  of  the  act,  paid.  to  a  seaman  volunteering  all  wages  then  due,  but  now,  they  only  undertook  to  pay  when  they  bad  received  from.  the  captain  or  the  owners.  In  this  case,  therefore,  the.  owners  felt  no  obligation  to  assist  them.  His  Honour'  said,  his  opinion  was  in  favour  of  Mr.  Parr,  but  he  would.  have  occasion  to  be  in  London,  and  he  would  then  lay  the  points  of  the  case  before  the  board  of  trade,  and  take  the  opinion  of  the  law  officers  on  it.  If  that  opinion  should  be  in  favour  of  Mr.  Forshaw's  views,  the  defend— defendants  ants defendants  should  have  the  benefit  of  it.  Here  his  Honour  took  up  the  bill  in  question,  and  looked  over  it,  observ observing  ing observing  that  he  had  not  seen  it  before.  He  called  Mr.  Forshaw's  attention  to  it,  and  asked  if  there  was  any  thing  in  the  act  which  enabled  the  captain  to  state  ma.  account  between  the  seaman  and  the  owners?  and  if  so,  whether  the  bill  was  not  itself  evidence  that  the  wages  , STYLE=superscript  were  due?  If  he  supposed,  for  instance,  that  was  an  action  for  the  wages;ind  that  a  letter  of  the  captain's  stating  the  amount  were  produced,  would  not  that  be  evidence  of  a  debt  due  by  the  owners,  and  would  not  the  captain  be  looked  upon  as  their  agent  Mr.  Far Farshaw  shaw Farshaw  said  he  had  not  before  seen  the  bill,  and  had  not  time  to  give  it  the  full  consideration  he  could  desire.  Ho  was  afraid  there  was  a  verdict  on  the  face  of  the  bill.  If  there  was  any  thing  which  left  it  open,  he  should  feel  more  assured,  but  he  feared  the  case  was  not  so.  His  Honour  said  he  should  give  a.  verdict  for  Mr.  Parr  that  day.  lf,  however,  Mr.  Forshaw  should,  upon  consideration,  think  that  there  was  any  war  of  raising  the  real  question  at  issue  in  the  case,  then  lie  would  grant  a  re-hearing  upon  affidavit.  It  was  then  understood  that  if  Mr.  Forshaw  could  see  any  way  of  opening  up  the  question  which  he  had  raised,  an  appli— application  cation application  should  be  made  for  a  re-hearing  on  Saturday  week.  The  plaintiff  was  not  present  in  this  ease,  having:  fallen  from  the  rigging  of  the  Phantom,  and  broken  his  leg,  and  the  action  therefore  proceeded  upon  the  bill,  as  it  had  been  drawn  by  the  captain.  The  seaman  had,  it  appeared,  been  required  to  go  on  board  the  Phantom  at  Hobson's  Bay,  and  Capt.  Forbes  at  the  same  time  was  required  to  give  the  hill.  MADDOX  V.  HOWARD.-This  was  an  action  brought  to  recover  the  amount  of  damage  done  to  a  coach  of  ti:e  plaintiff,  by  a  brewers'  cart  of  defendant.  The  amount  claimed  was  XI  7s  for  repairs,  and  Its  for  loss  of  time.  _  _  The  cause  of  action  arose  between  eight  and  nine  o'clock  on  the  evening  of  Friday,  the  9th  November  last.  It  appeared  from  the  evidence  of  a  policeman,  and  others,  that  the  coach  was  going  up  Scotland-road,  towards  Kirkdale,  and  the  brewers'  cart  was  coining  down.  The  centre  of  the  road  was  newly  macadaini6ed,  and  the  cart  turned  off  the  macadamised  part,  and  in  doing  so,  caught  the  hind  wheel  of  the  other  vehicle,  which.  appeared  to  have  been  upon  its  own  side  of  the  road,  and  caused  the  damage.  Several  witnesses  having  been.  heard  upon  both  sides,  who  gave  very  contradictory  tes-.  timony,  his  Honour  said  that  in  his  opinion  the  police-.  man  who  was  walking  behind  was  the  most  reliable:  witness  in  the  case;  he  therefore  gave  a  verdict  for  the  plaintiff  for  the  amount  claimed.  Mr.  Itoby  appeared  for  the  defence  in  this  case.  At  Vienna  it  is  stated  that  if,  from  the  proclamation  of  an  armistice,  peace  is  not  concluded  by  the  time  it  iS  practicable  to  open  the  campaign,  the  allied  fleets  will  enter  the  Baltic,  but,  during  the  negotiations,  will  not  pass  beyond  the  island  of  Gothland.  In  the  Crimea,  the  Tchernaya  and  the  defiles  which  lead  to  the  Valley  01  Baidar,  will  form  the  line  of  demarkation.  The  line  of  limitation  at  Kinburn,  Kertch,  and  Eupatoria,  will  be  fixed  by  mutual  agreement  between  the  allied  and  Misr'  Sian  commanders  SHIPPING  INTELLIGENCE  -4--  LIVERPOOL,  JANuAair  26.
