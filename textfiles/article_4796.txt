"TO  CORRESPONDENTS.  The  Daily  News  of  Saturday  copies  our  account  of  the  case  of  Mr.  Mc  Curtin,  but  not  very  generously  refuses  to  acknowlecge  the  source  whence  the  information  came.  The  Times  has  acted  in  a  directly  opposite  manner  :  for  having  availed  itself  of  a  portion  of  our  local  news  on  Saturday,  the  source  was  indicated,  as  was  just.  The  Daily  Express,  a  Dublin  paper,  in  its  number  of  Saturday,  takes  an  important  article  from  our  pages,  and  neglects  the  obviously  honest  course  of  pointing  out  the  source  of  its  information.  We  aro  happy  to  contriblte  to  the  intelligence  of  our  contemporaries,  but  surely  they  ought  not  to  grudge  us  the  compensating  right  of  an  acknowledgment.  is  intended  for  insertion  must  be  authenticated  by  the  name  and  address  of  the  writer;  not  necessarily  for  publication,  but  as  a  guarantee  of  his  good  faith.  We  cannot  undertake  to  return  rejected  communications.  All  communications,  Books  for  Review,  etc.,  to  be  for forwarded  warded forwarded  to  the  Editor  must  be  addressed  to  the  Publisher,  CHARLES  WIENER,  and  those  from  London  may  be  sent  to  the  care  of  Messrs.  Simpkin,  Marshall,  and  Co.  tarttnt"
