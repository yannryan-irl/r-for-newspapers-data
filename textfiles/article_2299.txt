TO  THE  ELECTORS  OF  PITT-STREET  WARD.  BETTER  LATE  THAN  NEVER  GENTVEMEN,—I  am  rejoiced  to  learn  that  our  highly  esteemed  townsman,  John  Smith,  Esq.,  has  consented  to  be  Nominated  at  the  ensuing  Election.  No  one  can  be  more  satisfied  than  I  am  myself,  that  however  willing  I  may  be,  I  certainly  do  not  possess  the  requisite  qualifications  for  a  Town  Councillor.  When  nominated  by  our  party  three  years  ago,  it  was  only  as  a  choice  of  evils  ;  the  committee,  as  it  was  said,  being  divided  between  myself  and  my  friend  Mr.  Callis,  it  was  thought  desirable  two  evils  always  to  choose  the  —and  I  was  selected.  Now,  however,  I  have  no  alternative  but  at  once  to  retire  from  the  field,  as  it  would  be  on  my  part  the  greatest  pre presumption  sumption presumption  to  place  myself  for  a  moment  in  competition  with  a  man  in  every  respect•  so•  much  better  qualified  to  be  your  Representative.  In  returning  to  private  life,  I  again  sincerely  thank  you  for  having  for  three  years  allowed  me  to  enjoy  the  personal  gratification  of  a  seat  in  the  Liverpool  Town  Council.  _  I  am;  gentlemen,  your  obliged  servant  (but  not)  WALTER  P.

GENTLEMEN,  lAccept  the  invitation,  which  I  have  had  the  .  honour  to  receive  from  a  numerous  and  influential  body  of.  Electors  of  the  Ward,  to  become  a  Candidate  at  the  approaching  Election,  for  a  seat  in  the  Town  Council,  as  one  of  your  Representatives.  The  subject  - STYLE=superscript  which  at  this  period  more  particularly  enga engages  ges engages  the:  attention  of  the  Council  and  the  Inhabitants  of  the  Borough,  is,  the  Improvements  of  the  Town.  I  believe  that  no  part  of  the  community  is  more  interested  in  this  question  than  yourselves  ;  not  only  from  the  central  position  of  your  ward,  but  on  account  of  its  possessing  so  many  places  of  public  resort,  viz  :—the  Theatres,  the  Concert-hall,  St.  John's  Market,  the  Railway  Station,  and  St.  George's  Hall.  •  To  this  subject  your  Representatives  have  given  their  best  attention,  r  and  have  supported  those  Improve Improvements'  ments' Improvements'  which,  in  their  opinion,  are  first  called  for,  and  'which  will  be  embodied  in  an  application  to  Parliament  in  the  ensuing  Session.  I  take  this  opportunity  of  returning  my  sincere  thanks  for  the  kindness  and  courtesy  which  I  have  received  from  you,  during  the  twelve  years  I  have  been  honoured  with  your  confidence.  I  remain,  Gentlemen,  your  obedient  Servant,  JOHN  B.  LLOYD.  Exchange  Alley,  20th  October,  1853.  TO  THE  ELECTORS  OF  PITT  STREET  WARD.  GEN  TLEMEN,  N  an  ably  dtawn  Requisition,  presented  this  day  I  I  am  called  upon  to  allow  myself  to  be  NOMINATED  As  one  of  your  Representatives  in  the  Town  Council,  on,the  s  pecific  ground  that  an  attempt  is  to  be  made  to  placelhe  Electors  and  the  Elected  in  their  only  proper  position.  .As  it  is  known  that  I  am  not  ambitious  of  a  seat  in  the  Council;  and  have,  therefore,  never  asked  for  one,  I  can  well  afford  the  use  ormy  name,  if  it  will  serve  you,  in  fighting  that  battle  of  principle  so  clearly  set  forth  in  your  Requisi Requisition  tion Requisition  to  me,  and  in  the  one  intended  for  Mr.  Aikin—documents  which,  I  hope,  will  be  extensively  read  in  all  the  Wards.  Whether  you  win  or  lose,  as  far  as  the  choice  of  a  Repre Representative  sentative Representative  is  concerned,  the  result  will  be  of  no  consequence  to  me,  individually,  because  as  I  do  not  offer  myself,  or  soli solicit  cit solicit  your  votes,  I  can  neither  be  by  an  opponent  by  the  constituency.  But,  in  any  event,  if  _the  object  in  view  be  vigorously  supported,  the  men  of  Pitt Pittstreet  street Pittstreet  Ward  will  make  irresistible  progress  towards  establish establishing  ing establishing  the  only  true  principle  for  rendering  a  representative  body  what  it  ought  to  be  ;  while,  should  you  also  carry  your  own  Candidate,  your  triumph  will,  indeed,  be  worthy  of  the  best  struggle  that  can  be  made—not  for  any  man  breathing,  but  for  the  cause  you  have  evidently  at  heart.  Since  retiring  from  editorial  life,  I  have  declined  almost  all  public  labours  ;  but  should  your  zeal  for  a  great  principle  place  me  in  a  position  of  public  duty,  I  will  do  the  best  I  can  to  justify  your  noble  and  truly  constitutional  efforts.
