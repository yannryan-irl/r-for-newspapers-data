"Bucharest,  a  continuous  cannonade  was  heard  from  the  direction  of  the  Danube.  The  Post  also  says  that  a  despatch  left  Bucharest  from  Vienna,  on  Wednesday,  and  mentions  that  the  report  of  a  great  defeat  of  the  Russians,  at  Bucharest  proves  to  be  without  foundation.  There  had  only  been  some  skirmishing.  The  Post  states  in  a  leading  article,  that  it  does  not  attach  any  confidence  to  the  French  Consul's  despatch.  PARIS,  THURSDAY.  The  Times  says  there  is  a  telegraphic  despatch  from  Berlin,  that  the  Turks  have  gained  another  victory  at  Oltenitza  ;  no  date  or  other  details  are  given.  The  Times'  leading  article,  after  commenting  upon  the  various  reports,  laments  the  want  of  trust-  worthy  news."
