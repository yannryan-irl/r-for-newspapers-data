The  above  speaks  for  itself.  The  only  reply  we  need  make  is  that  we  choose  to  conduct  our  own  business  in  our  own  way  as  we  have  done  from  the  commencement  ;  that  we  pay  higher  wages  than  any  other  newspaper  in  Liverpool,  and  that  we  know  of  no  reason  why  we  should  study  the  whims  and  fancies  of  the  Liverpool  Typo Typographical  graphical Typographical  We  would  remind  the  authors  of  the  document,  however,  that  they  have  rendered  themselves  amenable  to,  the  law,  if  we  chose  to  act  as  vindictively  as  they  themselves  act.  We  can,  however,  afford  to  pity  and  forgive  their  malevolence,  notwithstanding,  after  three  months  hard  labour,  finding  their  circular  has  not  had  the  effect  desired,  the  authors  have,  we  have  been  given  to  understand,  made  an  appeal,  and  paid  bribes  to  certain  news  agents  not  to  exhibit  the  daily  contents  P  l STYLE=superscript  acard,  or  even  to  sell  the  NORTHERN  DAILY  TIMES.
