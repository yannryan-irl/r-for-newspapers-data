The  Ambassador,  who  is  very  deaf,  muttered.  some  unmeaning  excuse.  Itwas  thought  that  the  papers  would  allude  to  the  tic'  atter  to-day,  but  an  intimation  has  been  sent  to  them  not  to  do  so,  as  it  would  serve  no  object  to  envenom  the  matter  by  giving  it  publicity.  The  Paris  papers  have  therefore  said  nothing  on  it.  An  Imperial  decree,  on  the  proposition  of  the  Minister  of  the  Interior,  makes  one  promotion  to  the  rank  of  commander  in  the  Legion  of  Honour,  seven  to  that  of  officer,  and  lid  nominations  as  knights,  among  prefects,  sub-prefects,  mayors;  and  national  guards  ;  and  another  decree,  on  the  proposition  of  the  Minister  of  Public  Instruction,  gives  three  promotions  to  the  rank  of  officer,  and  28  nominations  as  knights,  among  members  of  the  clergy,  professors  in  colleges,  Ste.
