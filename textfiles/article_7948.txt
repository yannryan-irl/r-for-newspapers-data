"MONETARY  AND  COMMERCIAL.  LIVERPOOL,  SATURDAY  EVENING  The  Liverpool  Cotton  Market  has  been  rather  more  active  to-day,  but  in  consequence  of  the  liberal  supply  offering,  prices  are  with  difficulty  maintained.  The  sales  amount  to  7,000  bales,  and  include  1,000  taken  for  speculation  and  export.  A  return  of  the  number  of  vessels  that  have  entered  this  port  last  year  has  been  made  up,  from  which  we  learn  that  there  has  been  a  decrease  as  compared  with  the  previous  year,  the  numbers  were,  in  1854,  4,390,  and  in  1855  only  4,280,  being  a  reduction  of  182  vessels."
