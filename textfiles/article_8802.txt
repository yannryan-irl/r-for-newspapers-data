The  Liverpool  Corn  Market  was  less  buoyant  to-day,  and  the  price  of  wheat  declined  2d.  per  bushel  from  the  advanced  quotations  of  Friday.  Flour  was,  however,  6d.  to  lc  per  barrel  higher  than  on  this  day  week,  but  only  a  limited  business  was  done.  A  remarkable  vote  has  just  passed  the  Spanish  Cortes,  relative  to  the  issue  of  paper  currency  by  the  banks.  Recently  the  members  of  that  body  declared,  by  a  majority,  that  the  privileges  of  the  Bank  of  San  Fernando  were  not  exclusive  ;  now  they  have  recorded,  by  132  votes  against  12,  that  this  bank  shall  have  the  exclusive  privilege,  throughout  Spain,  of  issuing  notes  payable  to  bearer.

The  English  Stock  Market  to-day  was  much  stmdier  in  character,  and,  upon  the  ..‘.hole,  firmer.  A  lingering  hope  is  still  entertained  in  some  quarters  that  Russia  will  make  further  concessions,  in  view  of  the  extensive  preparations  of  the  Allies  for  the  next  campaign.  Stock  Exchange  business,  however,  is  greatly  restricted,  owing  to  the  prevail prevailing  ing prevailing  uncertainty.  The  Funds  advanced  per  cent.  this  morning,  but  afterwards  showed  less  buoyancy,  and  at  the  close  of  the  Stock  Exchange  were  quoted  the  same  as  yesterday,  namely,  at  86-7,-  to  87.  Dur During  ing During  the  subsequent  non-recognised  hours,  there  was  a  sudden  rise  of  1  per  cent.,  but  the  grounds  for  this  advance  did  not  generally  transpire.  The  rates  of  discount  are  maintained,  but  the  supply  of  money  is  good.  At  Paris  to  day,  the  Three  per  Cent.
